		<h2>My Projects</h2>
		<h3 id="mappingtool"><a href="aka/mappingtool">Mapping tool</a> (2021, Ongoing)</h3>
		<p>
			I'm developing a map making application (<a href="aka/mappingtool">see news</a>) for authors and storytellers and people who can't draw. It could be used by fantasy authors to plan their worlds, RPG players to keep track of their games, or just for fun! I began development as part of my Senior Honors project at MVNU.
		</p>
		<h3 id="ifiv"><a href="aka/ifiv">Interactive Freight Infrastucture Viewer</a> (2019)</h3>
		<p>
			IFIV is a toy project to illustrate the complexity of supply chains. It provides an interactive display of products, industries, and transport methods in an interconnected web.
		</p>

		<h2>My Contributions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://minetest.net">Minetest</a> is a voxel-based game engine with a ton of games and mods. I've done work on the engine itself, as well as some games and mods of my own.</li>
			<li><a href="https://cataclysmdda.org">Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</a> is a great, complex survival game; I've written some features and bugfixes as I came across them.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="experience">Automated workflow app for the Community Emergency Response Team</h2>
		<h3>Spring 2022</h3>
		<p>
			As part of my Introduction to Software Engineering class, my team and I developed a mobile app using <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a> to digitize part of the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/preparedness-activities-webinars/community-emergency-response-team">Community Emergency Response Team</a> workflow to evaluate disaster preparedness. The software was built for Dr. Hicks of the emergency management department, who provided system requirements.

		<h2 class="experience">Computer Science Lab Assistant</h2>
		<h3>Fall 2021 -- Fall 2022</h3>
		<p>I've worked as a Computer Science lab assistant at MVNU for three semesters. I've helped many students in both Computer Science I and II to grasp concepts and develop their programming problem solving skills. In this position, I have troubleshooted technical issues in development tools and workstations, explained concepts to students, mentored students through the learning process, debugged esoteric errors, and helped students succeed in the computer science program.</p>

		<h2 class="experience">Acts of kindness tracker for a church</h2>
		<h3>Fall 2021</h3>
		<p>For my Database Systems class I worked with a team of my fellow students to develop a "Kindness Scanner" for my team member's church. The scanner tracks acts of kindness through QR card scanning and a pay-it-forward system. We designed a database and built a PHP-based web app to track the acts of kindness.</p>

		<h2 class="experience">Computer Science Peer Tutor</h2>
		<h3>Fall 2020 -- Present</h3>
		<p>I've tutored for many computer science classes at MVNU, including Computer Science I &amp; II, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Systems, and Computer Networks and Telecommunications. As a peer tutor, I have worked closely with students who wanted to improve their understanding of these classes and concepts. Each student learns in their own way, and I have mentored students to successfully develop their own learning habits. I have worked with students through difficult material, showing them how to read, manage, and apply knowledge. Besides Computer Science, I have tutored for a Theology course and Mathematics course. Many learning habits carry over between subjects and fields!</p>
