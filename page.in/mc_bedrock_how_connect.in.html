<p>Connecting to a Minecraft Bedrock server is somewhat hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. Unlike in Java edition, the direct connection controls are clearly an alternate option.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Go to the Play menu</h2>

	In the <b>Play</b> menu, select the <b>Servers</b> tab on the right. At the bottom of this tab you can add a direct connection to your server.

<p>
	Add a new server from the <b>Servers</b> tab. You must give it a description, and then input the <b>address</b> and <b>port number</b> of the server. You can then play on the server or save it for later. Either way, it will now appear in the server list each time you open Minecraft.
