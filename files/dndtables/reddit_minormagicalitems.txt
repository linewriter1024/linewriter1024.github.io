A square sheet of flat metal with a magic rune on top that heats up when the command word is spoken. (A hotplate)

Two identical mugs. Anything placed into a single mug will disappear and reappear in the other.

A napkin that never gets dirty.

Rings and collars that makes the user exude an necrotic aura. This aura is so faint it can only kill bugs (so it's regularly used as a way to kill fleas and other parasites) and plants you touch (also used for weeding).

a potted mushroom about 6 inches tall, and a vial labeled of "Moonspring Water". If the water is put onto the mushroom, it instantly becomes gargantuan sized in 1 turn, big enough to make a small home out of it.

A clockwork turtle. Wind it up, and it walks very slowly down a path for up to 60 feet. Weighs about 50 pounds, and is nearly indestructible. Great for testing traps, but is somewhat noisy and can alert nearby mobs.

A stone with symbol of a beard on it. Speaking the words to activate it as a bonus action will summon an illusion of three tiny (cat-sized) dwarves that start causing mischief (brawling with each other, slinging insults at random people, running around in circles). They come from logical places, and require DC 16 Wisdom save or physical contact to see through it, otherwise they either avoid physical contact.

A harp, that when played well, summons a harmless intangible spirit that will guide the players with advice, but will also be very judgmental of their choices. He will especially make fun of their ability to play the harp, and sarcastic whenever possible.

Beer Stein that can be used as a mace, however a mace proficiency would not apply, and one cannot be proficient with this weapon. When liquid is put into it, it never spills. If an alcoholic beverage is put into it, and you hit someone with it, they make a Constitution save DC 10 (or the DC of the alcohol if higher) else become drunk (poisoned) for 1 minute or until save ends, and the drink inside vanishes. (I figure this is no different than applying poison to a dagger, just cheaper, and with no prof. bonus)

Pretty Ring. The permanent effects of a Prestidigitation spell to keep the wearer clean and well groomed. Their clothes are never stained, their skin is always freshly washed, and a faint odor of lavender always surrounds them. A noble in the castle court would kill for this, but an adventurer would throw it out.

Plow of Giant Strength. A large steel plow, with handles and frame built at 3-4x the normal thickness. There is no harness attachment in front - instead, the person grasping the plow gains enough strength to drive it through the earth themselves! A farming community would love one of these, but adventurers would spend 30 minutes arguing how the kobold's body is technically a kind of soil...

Potion of Water Breathing. This potion is contained in a delicate spherical bottle that shimmers like mother-of-pearl and has been labeled in merfolk writing. The drinker's lungs fill with a continual source of oxygenated water that makes them immune to drowning as well as any kind of toxic gases. They are also unable to talk for the duration of the spell, as the best they can manage is a splattering gurgle. Lasts 2d4 hours. 

Meat Flute. Formed from the long bone of an unknown beast, this instrument creates the strong smell of fresh roasted meat when played. Different chords can produce the smells of different varieties of meat e.g. beef, mutton, pork, orc, dragon, kobold etc

Shiv of Healing. Deals 1d4 damage, then heals 2d4 health. X charges. Important to note that it deals the damage first. Leads to some funny situations where the victim takes more damage than is healed, or even sometimes killed before the healing can take effect

    Belt that when worn allows the wearer to sit down and a fancy chair to appear behind them.

    Lamp that when rubbed produces a genie like creature. Offers to grant three wishes but really the creature has no such power. Excellent conversation partner but will continue to cajole the lampâ€™s owner into making wishes as it gains some perverse pleasure in knowing their desires and not granting them.

    Blanket with a depiction of the star of a different planet. Those underneath it will feel the warmth of a bright sunny day. Occasionally depicts an eclipse.
