<p>I tried my hand at a <a href="https://cataclysmdda.org">Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</a> screenshot and text let's play, featuring <a href="tags/cdda_raymon">Raymon Ortega: Would-be Wizard</a>. It was really fun to write, but there's a few points I'll remember for next time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose a more active start. Most of this let's play wasn't very exciting, just trying to get to the refugee center. There wasn't much action. Maybe a megacity playthrough?</li>
	<li>Build more story. Getting missions and/or goals sooner will give drive to the character and make the story interesting.</li>
	<li>Play patiently. The LP can be built slowly; no need to rush objectives. Raymon probably didn't have to 100% get to the refugee center, I could have built up gear and spells where I was before I reached the refugee center.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do want to try another. C:DDA is a great game for text-based let's plays, and if I keep in my what I learned here, I'll be able to have even more fun and put out an even better let's play.</p>
