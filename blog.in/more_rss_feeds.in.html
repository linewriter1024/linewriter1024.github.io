<p>I've added more RSS feeds, one for each blog tag. This allows people to subscribe to only, say, <a href="tags/mappingtool">the mappingtool tag</a>. I can, in this way, use my blog easily as a set of smaller blogs for each category.</p>

<p>This took just a bit of work in the website build script; and I cleaned it up a bit so it doesn't commit temporary files and doesn't need to work so hard to find the root of the website when I'm already passing that information in the script. I do need to refactor it more, it's getting rather unwieldy, though still pretty simple to work with.</p>
