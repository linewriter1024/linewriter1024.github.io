<h2 id="picture-and-performance">Picture and Performance</h2>
<p>Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements–far less jerking the map around–as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more.</p>

<p>New features and fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to extend and merge existing map objects.</li>
<li>Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you’re drawing on or panning over the map.</li>
<li>Greatly improved graphics: terrain is varied and pops out for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-final-stretch">The Final Stretch</h2>
<p>Every main feature is now implemented. Performance tuning, testing, and graphical improvements are the primary concerns now: tweaking and optimizing the mapping tool for your satisfaction. As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and feedback!</p>
