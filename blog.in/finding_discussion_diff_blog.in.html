<p>I couldn't find much about <a href="https://diff.blog">diff.blog</a> with a cursory glance over the internet, so I went looking.</p>

<p>On diff.blog itself I discovered a post from <a href="https://blog.jromanmartin.io/2020/10/20/my-blog-in-diff-blog.html">Roman Martin's blog</a> when diff.blog found him back in 2020 the same way they did me recently.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23914454">Hacker News subthread</a> from 2020, where the creator of diff.blog, <a href="https://vishnuks.com/">Vishnu KS</a>, is promoting it. Here's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29759370">smaller subthread</a> from 2022, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27302496">another subthread</a> from 2021, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24540786">one more</a> from 2020.</p>

<p>One of the HN threads was linked in a <a href="https://jerieljan.com/learnings/2020-07-22/">blog post</a> from jerieljan.</p>

<p>There've been HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=diff.blog">submissions</a> of diff.blog, and a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bq6w1c/diffblog_follow_blogs_of_all_your_favourite/">Reddit post</a>, but none have taken any traction.</p>

<p>diff.blog is briefly mentioned in <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/06/19/discovered-new-websites-apps-and-extensions-for-this-week/">techweez article</a>, <a href="http://disq.us/p/2pgp555">a comment on a contentmarketinginstitute.com article</a>, and a <a href="https://olegsemerikov.medium.com/copywriting-for-it-how-to-make-your-writing-cool-98a87ea11e63">Medium post</a> from Oleg Semerikov.</p>

<p>That's all I've found so far, seems a small project but I wanted to dig up as much discussion as I could!</p>
