<p>I presented my <a href="../aka/mappingtool">Mapping Tool</a> for fifteen minutes at <a href="https://www.mvnu.edu/undergraduate/academics/honorsprogram/surc">MVNU's <abbr title="Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creative Work">sURC</a></a> on April 5th, taking home the first place prize of the Symposium. My friends and faculty showed up en masse at my presentation, making for a lively Q&amp;A and a really fun time.</p>

<p>sURC itself was interesting. There were around twenty presenters in total. The Honors students presented their senior projects and other students presented their summer research projects in a conference format. In my room we had a wide variety of presentations: an analysis of continuous glucose monitors in diabetic patients, a presentation of a concussion-detecting device for athletes, an examination of religion and spirituality in occupational therapy, and my own software project.</p>

<p>This sURC presentation was my presentation for the Honors program portion of my project, so in it I focused on how user feedback shaped the development of the mapping tool with an overview of project features and the development process. Later I'll have a twenty-five minute presentation on the details of programming and engineering the project.</p>
