<h3 id="why-text">Why text?</h3>

<p>Text-based games have an extremely good <em>complexity/development time</em> ratio. There are no graphics to worry about, no programmer art beyond writing (what luck, I happen to enjoy writing), no controls beyond text processing, no frames per second, et cetera, et cetera. Fully text based games can be even more complex than turn-based 2D roguelike games like <a href="https://cataclysmdda.org/">Cataclysm: DDA</a>. There's just less extra to worry about&mdash;the development focus has one of the most basic interfaces imaginable.</p>

<p>
	The specific style of text-based game I'm talking about is the text adventure game. The computer tells you about your environment, your circumstances, and your character, and you choose what your character does or says. It's simple, straightforward, and very reminiscent of the conversational style of a tabletop RPG.

<p>The problem is, a human game master will always be better than a computer here, right? A human game master can simulate any situation, can mediate any conflict, can act any character. (I exaggerate, but not very much.) A computer must be programmed to handle every specific situation in the game's world.</p>

	You can make <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> play a roleplaying game with you. ChatGPT can be the game master, simulate the environment, accept the actions of your character, whatever you might want. A couple of pitfalls prevent full immersion, however. ChatGPT forgets details and must be reminded, and it can't stay on track with a game system, being a more freeform storyteller. I want something better.
