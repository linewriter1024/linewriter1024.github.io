<p>This is a test post. I recently set up <a href="https://freshrss.org">FreshRSS</a> and I wanna make sure it's automatically updating correctly. I also am still waiting on <a href="https://diff.blog">diff.blog</a> to update automatically. There's just a bunch of automatic things that I have to make sure are automatic. Huh.</p>
