<p>This is the first draft of a scene I'll be using much later. I wrote it for a creative writing class prompt, as it fit the prompt of having characters unable to say what they really mean. It's a bit inspired by Hemingway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Like_White_Elephants">Hills Like White Elephants</a> since I read that just before writing this, and the prompt itself leads along those lines.</p>

<h2>Scene</h2>
<p>Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones in her ear. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.</p>
<p>“Lusha?” Her father's soft voice came metallic and worried.</p>
<p>“Baba, I need to know something.”</p>
<p>He didn't say anything.</p>
<p>“Baba?”</p>
<p>“What is it, love?”</p>
<p>“How did you get me to the university?”</p>
<p>The briefest pause, then he said “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Baba—!” Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, “Baba, something happened and I’ve gotta know.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I wanna know. I have to know.”</p>
<p>“What happened, Lusha?” He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat on their living room table with a chair on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.</p>
<p>“Is that Lusha, Eli?” her mothers voice came through the line. “Oh, Lusha, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I was asking how I got to… here,” said Lusha.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said her mother.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” said her father. “Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Are you gonna tell her?”</p>
<p>He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. “It’ll be okay. It’s okay. You can go back to the bread.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to yet.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” said Lusha.</p>
<p>“He won’t tell me either.”</p>
<p>“It’s my business.”</p>
<p>“It’s my business too,” said Lusha. “I told you, something happened.”</p>
<p>“We need to talk,” he said. “Later.”</p>
<p>“I can’t talk later. I won’t have a telephone.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry love, I can’t.”</p>
<p>“If you can’t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can’t tell just me? Eli?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say what it is. Just say there’s something. Don’t look at me like that.”</p>
<p>“Moma?” said Lusha.</p>
<p>“Your father’s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.”</p>
<p>Lusha weighed her words. “Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.”</p>
<p>“I want him to say it.”</p>
<p>“Moma please. I don’t have any time.” Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn’t hung up yet.</p>
<p>“Eli, say it. Just say you’re hiding it!”</p>
<p>Her father choked out a guttural sob. “Girls, please…”</p>
<p>“Baba?” The handset was too heavy.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. “He ran out the door.”</p>
<p>“Is he okay?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What do you know? I have to know.”</p>
<p>“I want you to come home first.”</p>
<p>“I can’t!”</p>
<p>“Not over the telephone.” Now she was crying.</p>
<p>Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. “Moma,” she whispered.</p>
<p>A big commotion came over the telephone. “Eugh! There’s a rat chew—” the line went flat.</p>
<p>“Hey Lusha,” said the girl next to her, “Is everything alright?”</p>
<p>Lusha couldn’t say.</p>
