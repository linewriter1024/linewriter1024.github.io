<p>I made an <a href="feed.xml">RSS feed</a> for my blog! It's a really simple format; I was able to implement my feed just by following the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>. Of course, RSS readers are a little less common than they were a decade ago; but there are plenty of extensions for Firefox---I'm using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rsspreview/">RSSPreview</a> just to test the feed---and with how easy it was to extend my blog generator to generate XML alongside HTML I figured it was better to have a feed than not.</p>
