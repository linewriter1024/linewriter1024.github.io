<p>
    I ran into <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-6830">JBR-6830</a>. When using Intellij IDEA on KDE Plasma 6 (OpenSUSE Tumbleweed), I was getting random very noticeable lag spikes.
    The solution was to add <pre><code>-Dwatch.desktop.geometry=false</code></pre> to the Intellij IDEA custom VM options.

    No more lag spikes!
