<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for supporting the development of the mapping tool with your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions!</p>
<p>Version 0.6.2 of the mapping tool is out, with several important improvements including unlimited scale and image exporting. This is the last version of the mapping tool to be developed as an MVNU project, as I have graduated! In the future, the mapping tool will be developed as an open source project.</p>
<p>You can download it here: <a href="https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options">https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options</a></p>

<h2 id="image-exporting">Image Exporting</h2>
<p>You can now save parts of the map as images to be used as illustrations for a book, for a website, or for whatever you want.</p>
<h2 id="unlimited-scale">Unlimited Scale</h2>
<p>The scale of your maps is now unlimited, with a few handy controls to set exactly what scale you want to edit your map at at any given moment: you can edit on the scale of meters to design a city, or on the scale of hundreds of kilometers to design a continent. Whatever you like, all in the same map.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
<p>Just because I graduated doesn’t mean that the mapping tool is done. I’m going to keep working on it! Features like altitude controls, better performance, alternate graphical styles, and more are all in the pipeline. I’ll also be releasing the tool as an open source project so that anyone interested can contribute ideas, code, and art.</p>
