	I successfully ascended with my 30th win in the <a href="https://crawl.develz.org">Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup</a> roguelike, playing an Octopode Cinder Acolyte of Jiyva. This was a really fun run, relying on Statue Form and Dragon's Call by the end. Dragon's Call, in particular, seems like one of the most powerful, if not <em>the</em> most powerful, spells.
