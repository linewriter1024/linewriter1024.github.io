	<title>DCSS deities on the surface</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org/&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; has a large pantheon, but in the dungeon their abilities and themes are heavily combat-focused. What might they be like on the surface of the world?

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ashenzari&quot;&gt;Ashenzari the Shackled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ashenzari is the chained god of secrets and curses.
	It is said that Ashenzari is eternally bound to the sky.
	On the surface, Ashenzari is the patron of secrets and hidden knowledge.
	In rural areas Ashenzari is said to offer divining knowledge of deep water springs and rich coal mines, always in exchange for a curse.
	In the city Ashenzari is evoked by politicians seeking secrets and those trying to pry out the hidden dalliances of their spouse. The knowledge Ashenzari offers is great, but something must be cursed for Ashenzari to reveal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beogh&quot;&gt;Beogh the Brigand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beogh is the god of the wanderers and outcasts. Native deity of the orcish race, Beogh does not discriminate.
	All those who seek to scrape a living on the borders of society may offer their worship to Beogh.
	Outlaw farmers outside the jurisdiction of a king pledge their fidelity to Beogh, hoping to stave off raids by other ne&#x27;er-do-wells and keep their harvest for themselves.
	All manner of rogues and thugs use the tenuous tie of Beogh-worship to avoid conflict within their ranks; this is a form of honor even among thieves.
	An offering or supplication to Beogh is usually of social purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheibriados&quot;&gt;Cheibriados the Contemplative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cheibriados is most often called upon by the elderly seeking to slow the passage of time and enjoy what years they have remaining.
	Mighty kings have given great offerings to preserve their kingdoms, and farmers dreading the arrival of winter have begged Cheibriados to hold back the changing of the seasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dithmenos&quot;&gt;Dithmenos the Shadowed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If Beogh is the god of social outlaws, then Dithmenos is the god of the loners.
	All deeds that must be kept hidden are best done under a prayer to Dithmenos.
	Small shrines in the cities are visited at the witching hour by desperate men seeking not forgiveness but a cloak to hide their sins.
	It is said that those who wear the symbol of Dithmenos are never sorry for what they&#x27;ve done, and neither will they have to be sorry for being caught.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elyvilon&quot;&gt;Elyvilon the Healer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All peoples of the world pray to Elyvilon the healer. The symbols of Elyvilon are found in every city, over every hearth, for Elyvilon gives health and life to a world struggling with pain and darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fedhas_madash&quot;&gt;Fedhas Madash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fedhas Madash was originally the god of the Elvish people, but over time all people have come to offer their crops and services in exchange for rich harvests and long-preserved food. When Fedhas Madash is angry, all suffer, but when Fedhas Madash is pleased, civilization blooms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gozag ym sagoz&quot;&gt;Gozag Ym Sagoz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gozag Ym Sagoz was brought from the underworld by the Gnomes and the Dwarves, but Humans found Gozag a pleasant companion in business and trade, for like Gozag, humanity enjoys the sound of clinking gold coins. All merchants and politicians will whisper a few words to Gozag on occasion, and to many the temples of Gozag Ym Sagoz are the pinnacle of their social circles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hepliaklqana&quot;&gt;Hepliaklqana the Forgotten&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is said that the humans remember their ancestors most out of all races of the world, because of their uniquely short lifespans and struggle to remember the past. Hepliaklqana might, therefore, be said to be a human god, but this is far from the truth. Anyone who wishes to remember the past will make an offering to Hepliaklqana, and the most devoted priests and faithful bards can recall in great detail long histories and storied individuals, albiet at the cost of their own health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Stories have been told of misers who forgot the location of their hidden gold and made offering to Hepliaklqana, only to find their deceased ancestors standing at the very spot and calling to join them in death.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ignis&quot;&gt;Ignis the Dying Flame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In ages past, Ignis was the god of humans. They found fire in the wilderness, and there Ignis burned like a flame. But now humanity has moved past the primal fire, and their concerns are with the likes of Gozag Ym Sagoz and Vehumet. Ignis is a fading god, and Ignis&#x27;s flames will soon die out, but in hovels and distant villages there are still fires burning in service to Ignis, and there they are more warm and comforting than the furnaces of the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jiyva&quot;&gt;Jiyva the Shapeless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The slimes and creatures of chaos worship Jiyva. Lycanthropes, aberrations, horrors from beyond. It is said that Jiyva is not from this plane of existence, but dallies here on some cosmic interlude. Those who make petition of Jiyva are seeking some change in their lives or their bodies, and more often than not the strange priests of Jiyva are happy to oblige. If Elyvilon fails, then the most desperate will turn here next.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Kikubaaqudgha&quot;&gt;Kikubaaqudgha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kikubaaqudgha gives knowledge and power to those who practice necromancy. In all civilized realms Kikubaaqudgha-worship is banned, but small bone pyres and hidden shrines can be found in the dark places of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Lugonu&quot;&gt;Lugonu the Unformed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lugonu is, like Jiyva, from far off. But unlike Jiyva, Lugonu desires to change not only the bodies of creatures, but the world itself. At times Lugonu has been called upon during war, to scour the earth, or during times of great disaster, to reshape nature. But there is little that Lugonu does for those who supplicate, and much that Lugonu does for Lugonu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Makhleb&quot;&gt;Makhleb the Destroyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An ancient god of violence, Makhleb is keeper of the fiendish keys. Those who wish to cause chaos and summon demons to do their will call upon the name of Makhleb. A man seeking revenge might give up his sanity in exchange for strength, and a general desiring victory might gain preternatural charisma from a visit to the blood-temple of Makhleb.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Nemelex&quot;&gt;Nemelex Xobeh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The gambler&#x27;s god, Nemelex Xobeh is also a favorite of the merchants. Shysters, stock brokers, and investors willing to take risks will at times make sacrifice to Nemelex or consult the cards to see what might be in their future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Okawaru&quot;&gt;Okawaru the Warmaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every soldier knows the name of Okawaru, and adventurers and knights alike will devote much time to this study. The strength of Okawaru, in the heat of battle, may be the different between living and dying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Pakellas&quot;&gt;Pakellas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pakellas is the patron of artificers and scientists. Those who create machines and magical devices call upon Pakellas to support their efforts, and the temples of Pakellas are great libraries and laboratories of learning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Qazlal&quot;&gt;Qazlal Stormbringer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The great dragon, Qazlal is a bolt of thunder in the sky and a gentle mist on a spring evening. Farmers and sailors beg Qazlal to change the course of nature&#x27;s fury, and it is said among the merchant captains that no good voyage begins but with the crew in a temple to Qazlal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Ru&quot;&gt;Ru the Awakened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like Ashenzari, Ru demands sacrifice in exchange for knowledge. But Ru&#x27;s sacrifices are not of posessions or curses laid upon your belongings. Ru demands your body and mind, and the knowledge received is metaphysical. Those who worship Ru seek enlightenment or cannot find peace in any other way. All those who sacrifice will receive the secrets of the universe, but the weight of Ru&#x27;s revelation is often too much to bear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Sif&quot;&gt;Sif Muna the Loreminder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Magical secrets live within the heart of Sif Muna. All wizards worship Sif Muna, and the loremasters flock to the temples of Sif Muna for ancient tomes and crumbling scrolls preserved by her power.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Trog&quot;&gt;Trog the Wrathful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trog is a hunter&#x27;s god. Those who worship Trog do so in the wilderness, summoning the courage and stamina for a long hunt, be their quarry man, beast, or monster.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Uskayaw&quot;&gt;Uskayaw the Reveler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uskayaw demands a party! Every joyful gathering can be made better with an invocation of Uskayaw, and the temples of Uskayaw are filled with music and drums even in the dimmest hours of the night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Vehumet&quot;&gt;Vehumet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vehumet is the god of magic energy. Where Sif Muna controls the forces of the arcana, Vehumet is the force itself. Ignis is the god of the fire, Vehumet is the god of the energy behind the fire. Vehumet is not personable, but where power is needed, whether in a great engine or in a work of magic, folk are wise to call upon Vehumet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Xom&quot;&gt;Xom the Unpredictable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Xom is a trickster, but even those who visit a shrine to Xom&#x27;s insanity will find it a toss of the coin whether they will be helped or hindered. Many fey are bound to Xom, or Xom to they, and it is said that the greatest fey creatures are Xom&#x27;s own spawn, albiet slightly more sane.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Yredelemnul&quot;&gt;Yredelemnul the Dark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yredelemnul is the dreadful god of death. The domain of Yredelemnul is cold, and concerned with matters of ghosts and reanimation. If one has need to call upon Yredelemnul, it may be to offer a ripe harvest of battle, or to lay claim upon a spirit ere it leaves the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some fear that Yredelemnul is the force awaiting all life after it has died, but Yredelemnul does not hold sole sway over these matters. Yredelemnul is concerned with the bones and echoes of that which is deceased. It is said that Elyvilon, Hepliaklqana, and Ru hold equal part in death: Elyvilon brings comfort, Hepliaklqana records the memory and deeds, Ru guides the spirit out of the world into the brilliant horizon, and Yredelemnul vainly rages that life may thus be held so sacred. Only the most vile deeds and horrific abuses lead away from the Three Guardians and to the black torch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Zin&quot;&gt;Zin the Law-Giver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where Elyvilon is forgiving and merciful even to the evil, Zin demands justice. Magistrates are wise to invoke his name, but let them beware if they fall into corrupt deeds. An innocent man would do well to offer tithe at the temple of Zin before appearing in court, and woe betide one who swears falsely before Zin&#x27;s clerics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tso&quot;&gt;The Shining One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The forces of darkness, corruption, and evil are met with The Shining One. Paladins of The Shining One destroy demons and the undead where they find them, and are mortal enemies of Yredelemnul, Lugonu, and their ilk. If a dark presence finds its way into the corner of an attic, it is a cleric of The Shining One who will drive the specter away.
&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>DCSS win: Powerfully lucky DsCj</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had an amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org/&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; win with a great heap of luck. I played a Demonspawn Conjurer with a heap of lucky mutations and incidents, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Three early acquirement scrolls and a potion of experience&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Worshipping Vehumet from a faded altar - the perfect conjurer God&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mutating magic regeneration early&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mutating paralyzing spells&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mutating spirit shield, which 2nd level comes with HP regen converted to MP regen when low on MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the game, it felt like I needed almost no downtime: with Vehumet and all my sources of MP regen I could spam 4th level spells indefinitely: &lt;i&gt;Iskenderun&#x27;s Mystic Blast&lt;/i&gt; is very powerful when you can cast it every turn for free, and &lt;i&gt;Plasma Beam&lt;/i&gt; was my next spell of choice. I wonder if demonspawn mutations are affected by skills or stats, because almost everything I mutated just made the caster playstyle stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maxwell&#x27;s Capacitive Coupling&lt;/i&gt; is a great spell. I&#x27;d cast it once, often paralyzing the enemy due to my mutations, then regenerate almost all the MP it took to cast by the time it fired off and obliterated the nearest foe. I deleted four orbs of fire in a row using just this spell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brom&#x27;s Barrelling Boulder&lt;/i&gt; combined with &lt;i&gt;Iskenderun&#x27;s Mystic Blast&lt;/i&gt; let me destroy enemies with great MP efficiency without them ever touching me once.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plasma Beam&lt;/i&gt; once again takes the title of most used spell: it delivers unparalleled damage and is a beam spell!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>Arcana Technoclysm update: Magical UPS, whistle crafting, and bionic installation</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve updated my mod &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/cdda-arcana-technoclysm&quot;&gt;Arcana Technoclysm&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: DDA&lt;/a&gt; with some more new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the changes. The vehicle whistles can now be crafted from each other, so if you find the boat whistle and really wanted the motorcycle whistle you can still craft it. The recipes are written in the Cleansing Flame book and the arcana lab journal. Also, there are some more Technoclysm item spawns in the strange warehouse, so poke around! Technoclysm items can also spawn rarely with other Arcana items in labs or magic locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first new feature is an eternal UPS (power supply) which uses magical energy to constantly provide power to UPS-enabled tools. It has a recharge rate of about 2 kJ per minute and is fairly small, and can be either crafted or found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and more important, new feature is a magical means of installing bionics. &lt;i&gt;Bionic talismans&lt;/i&gt; can be crafted from any power storage or power generation CBM. Using the bionic talisman will temporarily summon a magical avatar of the bionic, who will install any bionic for you before disappearing. This provides a means of installing bionics outside of the Exodii using another otherworldly force who may be more or less friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>First Version of an Amethyst Farm</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through trial and error I have developed a kind of amethyst farm in Minecraft. It is neither pretty nor efficient, but it can be improved and it is easy to build. There are four parts to the system: the collection timer system, the piston matrix system, the allay collection system, and the transfer system. Each geode recieves its own copy of these systems, and the amethyst shards are transported to a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Timer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_timer_system.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timer system is a etho hopper clock with five items that is turned into a counter by locking one of the hoppers. Every time a random tick is observed from the sapling, one item is released from the locked hopper. When all five items have been released, the piston matrix fires and the hopper clock resets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This random tick counter is not the most efficient way to mine the amethyst, but it can be tuned and is better than losing valuable piston room to actually measure when the crystals grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Piston Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_piston_matrix.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piston matrix itself is tied to the timer. When the timer activates, all the pistons activate too, breaking the crystals. Some of the crystals will be fully grown, and these will drop two amethyst shards for collection. The pistons will then deactivate, waiting for the next cycle and letting the allays access the dropped items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Allay Collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_allay.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two allays are positioned to cover the entire geode. When the amethyst shards are dropped by the piston matrix, the allays grab up the shards and carry them to a noteblock that fires every couple seconds. They throw the items, which are then collected by hopper and hopper minecart to be sent upstairs. Care must be taken that the allays cannot get stuck inside crevices of the geode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Transfer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_transfer.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer system itself is simple: hopper minecarts collect the shards from the allay system and then put them into a dropped system powered by a clock, which shoots the items up into a water stream where they are collected in my base.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Recent great improvements in Cataclysm: DDA</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt; has recieved some really nice updates to the experimental branch in recent months. My top three are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/67907&quot;&gt;Default sort zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is huge! Now you can define a loot sorting zone as a catchall, where items will be sorted unless there&#x27;s a more specific zone for them to go into. Previously, every time I settled down in a location or mobile base, I would have to set every zone for every filter as many times as there were tiles. It was so tedious that I wrote a Bash script to do it for me using xdotool, a script that is entirely useless now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;mobile-base-zones script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash

. `which qterminal-helper`

# Custom zone letter
CUSTOM=j

# Delay between keys (msec)
DELAY=200

set -x

W=&quot;$(wmctrl -l | grep Cataclysm | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f1)&quot;
xdotool windowactivate &quot;$W&quot;
sleep 1

type() {
	xdotool type --delay $DELAY &quot;$(echo -e &quot;$1&quot;)&quot;
}

key() {
	sleep $(echo &quot;$DELAY / 1000&quot; | bc -l)
	xdotool key &quot;$@&quot;
}

zone() {
	pos=&quot;$1&quot;
	zone=&quot;$2&quot;
	type &quot;YA$zone\r$pos\r\r$CONFIRM&quot;
	key Escape
	type &quot;Y&quot;
}

customzone() {
	pos=&quot;$1&quot;
	filter=&quot;$2&quot;
	type &quot;YA$CUSTOM$filter\r\r$pos\r\r$CONFIRM&quot;
	key Escape
	type &quot;Y&quot;
}

. `which mobile-base-zones-config`

for pos in $GENERIC_P; do
	for zone in $GENERIC_Z; do
			zone &quot;$pos&quot; &quot;$zone&quot;
	done
done

for pos in $DUMP_P; do
	for zone in $DUMP_Z; do
			zone &quot;$pos&quot; &quot;$zone&quot;
	done
done
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;mobile-base-zones-config&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Y if vehicle, otherwise empty
CONFIRM=

# Collect positions from origin
GENERIC_P=&quot;&quot;
# Collect zones
GENERIC_Z=&quot;&quot;

# Dump positions from origin
DUMP_P=&quot;.&quot;
# Dump zones
DUMP_Z=&quot;0 a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q t u v w x y z C D E F G J I K&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/64334&quot;&gt;Plugging in tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is just great quality of life. Now players can plug tools like welders, soldering irons, and especially smartphones (with their unswappable batteries) directly into appliances or vehicle dashboards. This saves all the tedium of continually swapping out batteries, and makes using electric tools just that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/68686&quot;&gt;Brawling buff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there&#x27;s been a small buff to the Brawling style where waiting for a turn or two will grant a bonus to accuracy. This makes melee combat using the Brawling style feel more engaging, and gives more edge to early-to-mid-game melee combat.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Arcana Technoclysm: A small mod for Cataclysm: DDA</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: DDA&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;s premier magic mod is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Magiclysm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Magiclysm, which not only adds an entire magic system and slew of useful spells, items, and locations but also alters the lore of the game to imply that magic has existed throughout history. This lore breaks significantly from real world history, so I prefer mods that keep magic as something esoteric and hidden, such as the newly added mod &lt;i&gt;Mind Over Matter&lt;/i&gt; or the mature &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chaosvolt/cdda-arcana-mod&quot;&gt;Arcana&lt;/a&gt; mod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one particular spell from Magiclysm that I love that is not available in any other mod: the &lt;i&gt;Summon Motorcycle&lt;/i&gt; spell. This is amazingly useful and fun to play with, so I decided to port the idea over to Magiclysm in my own mod. This new mod, &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/cdda-arcana-technoclysm&quot;&gt;Arcana Technoclysm&lt;/a&gt;, currently adds three temporary summonable vehicles and a new location to find the magic whistles needed to summon these vehicles. It&#x27;s a simple mod but fills in the summonable vehicle gap in the more lore-friendly magic mods. The vehicles currently available are an amphibious boat with wheels, a motorcycle, and a horseless carriage with plenty of cargo space. Each of the vehicles is a tradeoff between maneuverability, compatible terrain, and cargo space, so hopefully players will have incentive to find strange warehouses and collect all the magic whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>World map for a Wesnoth campaign: The Paradise Trap</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/51b58ad218fc285717c7d5889fdfeda59f017ca6/data/core/images/maps/wesnoth.webp&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 160px&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;the wesnoth world map&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I&#x27;m working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wesnoth.org&quot;&gt;Battle for Wesnoth&lt;/a&gt; campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/wexlfu-tpt&quot;&gt;The Paradise Trap&lt;/a&gt;, set in the western sea off the coast of the Great Continent in the world of Wesnoth. The world of Wesnoth has a canonical map, but working with a nice-looking map is beyond the scope of my project for now. Fortunately for me, Wesnoth&#x27;s game map editor creates nice enough maps and has an automatable screenshot export function built in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/tpt_world_map_raw_0.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;the paradise trap world map before labels are added&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I built an approximation of the world map in the in-game map editor. This maps out the terrain of both the canonical continent and my own world building&amp;#8212;Paradise. The scale is certainly off, but it doesn&#x27;t matter; I&#x27;m not concerned about accuracy for this map which will only be used at the start of scenarios to roughly plot out the movement of the characters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/tpt_world_map_0.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;the paradise trap world map&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, I use ImageMagick to add labels to the map. The labels are drawn using a built-in Wesnoth font, so the style at least somewhat matches the game. This final image is then used at the beginning of each scenario, and can be used for spatial reference as I write the story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	This is all automated through a script that exports the wesnoth map of the world to an image and then uses a long &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt; invocation to add all the labels. The script is included below for reference.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Map generation script&lt;/h2&gt;

	echo &quot;Worldmap is up to date!&quot;
	if [[ -n &quot;$wx&quot; ]]; then
		return 0
	else
		exit 0
	fi

	<title>The new DCSS shapeshifter background (first win)</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I got a win playing an Armataur Shapeshifter of Okawaru in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; roguelike. This was my first Armataur win, as well as my first win and first real time playing the new shapeshifter background, which is replacing the old transmutations magic school. Unlike with the old transmutations school, this character didn&#x27;t have to cast spells at all, and I could focus on being a melee dude. And what a melee dude I was!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	During the whole game, I encountered only four &quot;talismans&quot; which allow me to shapeshift into different forms: Beast (which all shapeshifters start with), Maw, Blade, and Storm. Beast is a low level form, Maw and Blade are on the same level, and Storm is an end game form (measured by their minimum skill requirements). My basic strategy was to get the most powerful form I had online as soon as possible, training only shapeshifting until the next form was usable, because the forms grant immense powerups at the cost of locking out certain armor and weapon slots, or, in the case of storm form, all armor and weapons. Okawaru filled in the gaps, giving me the skill boosts I needed to keep up in the rest of my fighting skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Beast form isn&#x27;t very interesting: it gives a small boost to (unarmed) combat power in exchange for losing a lot of armor. Being an armataur helped here, because I had some natural mutations that weren&#x27;t overridden by the form that gave me more HP and natural armor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	For a short time in the mid-game I had the choice between Blade form and Maw form. Blade form is a straightforward powerup giving you powerful unarmed combat melee attacks. Maw form gives less unarmed combat power but a powerful auxiliary &quot;maw&quot; attack that lets you regain health during combat &amp;#224; la Makhleb. I was fairly underwhelmed by maw form: despite its healing power I felt I was giving up too much offense for the chance of an auxiliary attack, whereas blade form provided a simple, brutal damage boost while still letting me wear body armor. I only switched to Maw form when facing hydras.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	But those were just stepping stones on the way to the end-game form: Storm form. Storm form disables all armor and weapons, but grants it&#x27;s own significant AC and EV boosts plus insane damage output and a powerful Blinkbolt utility attack. Once I got shapeshifting up to level 21 (and I rushed for it) I switched to Storm form and never looked back. There is nothing in the game that could stand up to an Okawaru-boosted storm form armataur coming at them like a flying electric freight train. I deleted orbs of fire in a few hits. In exchange for this awesome power I was a bit of a glass cannon, lacking almost all resistances due to poor jewelry loot, but I still felt very powerful with some use of consumables and Okawaru.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	There are other end-game forms I never got access to: Dragon, Undead, and Statue (not sure if those are their actual names).
	Of these, Statue form seems the most interesting for the potential to wear equipment, and for extended I imagine Undead form would be popular, but I have no personal analysis of their strengths.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, shapeshifting feels like an improvement over the spell-based transmutations.
	I didn&#x27;t have to waste training magic and could focus on melee. Having the talismas as items wasn&#x27;t too bad for inventory pressure either, especially with the limited armor, but if I had dabbled in spells I might not have enjoyed carrying around the extra items. Right now, any melee character can start using shapeshifting, as evidenced by my Armataur which was a successful storm form menace despite having -3 shapeshifting aptitude. The new forms will probable need some balancing, but they&#x27;re really fun to play and eliminate much of the frustration and useless decision-making transmuters used to face. I look forward to playing another shapeshifter and trying some of the other end-game forms.
&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Prototype post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator for the Minetest engine</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&#x27;ve begun work on a game project, smaller in scope and more relaxing than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/textengine_intro&quot;&gt;text engine project&lt;/a&gt;. This new project uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; engine for voxel graphics, entities, and physics. This game, Roadtrip, is designed along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017180/The_Long_Drive/&quot;&gt;The Long Drive&lt;/a&gt; as a post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator and also takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt;. It&#x27;s written in Lua.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/roadtrip.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../thumbs/roadtrip.25.png&quot; alt=&quot;roadtrip game prototype&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minetest&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Voxels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine provides a solid base for this type of game: procedural generation, low-poly graphics, built-in multiplayer, etc. I have quite a bit of experience with Minetest and Lua, so it&#x27;s a good choice for game engine since I don&#x27;t want to put too much development effort into this game. The world will consist of &quot;voxels&quot;, blocks like in Minecraft that form the terrain, along with moveable &quot;entities&quot; such as the vehicles and the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic design of the game is the player driving down a road in a procedurally generated environment. The player must survive (food, water, gasoline/electricity, shelter, etc.) as long as possible while enjoying the view and trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like The Long Drive, Roadtrip will have a long highway extending indefinitely into the distance with a randomly generated environment surrounding it, maybe including side roads or broader road networks. The prototype environment will be a desert, but it will be easy to add new biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the prototype, the road runs from the south toward the north, with turns and corners defined by an equation that returns the X (east-west) coordinate of the road based on the Z (north-south) coordinate. The current equation is defined as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code language=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;local z_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()
local z_factor_2 = 160 + 160 * seed_random()
local x_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()

local function road_x(z)
	return math.floor(math.sin(z / z_factor) * (math.sin(z / z_factor_2) ^ 4) * x_factor + 0.5)
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; where &lt;em&gt;seed_random()&lt;/em&gt; is a random generator returning a random number between 0 and 1 according to the world seed. All other properties of the world, like the width of the road at any point, will be defined by similar procedural generation to ensure continuity as each chunk of the map is generated separately.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vehicles&quot;&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicles are the focus of Roadtrip, so they will be very customizable. Vehicles will be individual components internally, such as the chassis, the wheels, the doors, etc., which can then be installed together and the models attached to display an entire car, truck, or other vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;survival&quot;&gt;Survival&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survival elements including hunger, thirst, weather, and fuel will drive further exploration and resource gathering. There may be enemies as well, or some other active threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploration&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources will be available in structures off the road, in abandoned cars, or from natural resources like lakes or trees. This will encourage exploration off road, both with and without a vehicle. Terrain generation can be improved to have hills, valleys, caves, etc. to spice up the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Development Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine is limited in a number of ways that will make development more challenging. I do think my familiarity with the engine along the engine&#x27;s simplicity will make it worth it, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rotation&quot;&gt;Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most noticably, if the player is attached to an object and the object rotates, the player&#x27;s viewport does not rotate with the object. My workaround, rotating both at the same time, suffers from network lag causing noticable drift that the player must manually correct. I may need to contribute a feature to the engine to support this for more realistic driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collision&quot;&gt;Collision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For performance reasons, an object&#x27;s collisionbox cannot extend much beyond ~3 nodes in any direction before it starts to break. This means that entities like vehicles can&#x27;t be too big or their physics won&#x27;t work. Again, I may need to improve the engine here, or just live with innacurate collision on large vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hud&quot;&gt;Hud &amp;amp; Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the HUD and controls is a bit of a challenge as the Minetest engine is geared toward a Minecraft-like game. Nevertheless, I should be able to represent the dashboard on the HUD nearly as easily as the player&#x27;s own stats. Controls are also a little harder, with a limited number of keybinds available to the game. I can use movement keys for driving, and I may be able to use hotbar items for actions like shifting gears or quick access of weapons or tools.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Toward the ultimate text adventure game engine</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-adventures&quot;&gt;Text adventure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-text&quot;&gt;Why text?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Text-based games have an extremely good &lt;em&gt;complexity/development time&lt;/em&gt; ratio. There are no graphics to worry about, no programmer art beyond writing (what luck, I happen to enjoy writing), no controls beyond text processing, no frames per second, et cetera, et cetera. Fully text based games can be even more complex than turn-based 2D roguelike games like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org/&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: DDA&lt;/a&gt;. There&#x27;s just less extra to worry about&amp;#8212;the development focus has one of the most basic interfaces imaginable. Additionally, fully text-based games are perfect for screen readers due to their simple interface (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing-games.com/building-a-better-mud/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about writing a screen-reader friendly text-based game).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The specific style of text-based game I&#x27;m talking about is the text adventure game. The computer tells you about your environment, your circumstances, and your character, and you choose what your character does or says. It&#x27;s simple, straightforward, and very reminiscent of the conversational style of a tabletop RPG.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, a human game master will always be better than a computer here, right? A human game master can simulate any situation, can mediate any conflict, can act any character. (I exaggerate, but not very much.) A computer must be programmed to handle every specific situation in the game&#x27;s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai&quot;&gt;AI?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can make &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; play a roleplaying game with you. ChatGPT can be the game master, simulate the environment, accept the actions of your character, whatever you might want. A couple of pitfalls prevent full immersion, however. ChatGPT forgets details and must be reminded, and it can&#x27;t stay on track with a game system, being a more freeform storyteller. I want something better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;muds&quot;&gt;MUDs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The system I have in mind is similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MUD&amp;amp;oldid=1140275602&quot;&gt;MUD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@williamson.f93/multi-user-dungeons-muds-what-are-they-and-how-to-play-af3ec0f29f4a&quot;&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing-games.com/what-is-a-mud-multi-user-dungeon/&quot;&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;, which is fully text-based as you pilot your character through a multiplayer world. MUDs are, however, limited in a number of ways: they are generally room based, their multiplayer nature requires real-time interaction, their systems are quite gamey, and the &quot;dungeon master&quot; is primarily concerned with combat mechanics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;something-new&quot;&gt;Something new&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve started work on a new system at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;text engine&lt;/em&gt; is an effort toward building a flexible text-based game engine for simulating any scenario or world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To simulate combat and action mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To handle social interactions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To keep track of world events: political affiliations, kingdom economics, famines, shipping routes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To support singleplayer play or play with a small party&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To support any genre of game: high fantasy action, low fantasy economic, sci-fi space battle, zombie apocalypse, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very ambitious goals, but the text engine format lends itself well to managing all this complexity without the added requirements of graphical display and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a long-term project, so development may be quite slow. There is no time pressure, however, so I can take it at my pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;go&quot;&gt;Learning Go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is also a way for me to learn the Go language, which has some unique syntax and ideas that I think will be perfect for a large text-based game engine like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic structure is thus: everything in the world, whether a city, a man, a kingdom, a sword, or a lake, is an entity in relationship with other entities, capable of whatever actions and interactions make sense for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s example a sample scenario to illustrate the idea: a covered &lt;b&gt;wagon&lt;/b&gt; of four &lt;b&gt;merchants&lt;/b&gt; traveling down a &lt;b&gt;road&lt;/b&gt; through a &lt;b&gt;forest&lt;/b&gt;, about to be robbed by two &lt;b&gt;bandits&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;crossbows&lt;/b&gt;. You are the lone &lt;b&gt;guard&lt;/b&gt; for the &lt;b&gt;wagon&lt;/b&gt;, wielding only a &lt;b&gt;sword&lt;/b&gt; riding in the &lt;b&gt;front&lt;/b&gt; with the &lt;b&gt;driver&lt;/b&gt; while the other three &lt;b&gt;merchants&lt;/b&gt; are sitting in the &lt;b&gt;back&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bold word in that previous paragrah would be an entity (or a few entities). As an example, the wagon is an entity with two entities making it up: the front and the back. In the event that you wanted to hide underneath the wagon, an entity for the underneath would be generated as well. The front of the wagon is an entity that &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; you and the driver. This &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; relationship would be mirrored by &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; relationships that you and the driver have with the wagon. The wagon itself is &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the road, while the road &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; the wagon. The road itself is within the forest, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the complex interactions that can happen here. Each of the merchants and bandits has an AI corresponding with their generated personalities and skills, so some of the merchants might draw weapons while others might seek cover in the wagon from the bandits&#x27; crowssbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue would be represented by ideas, such as &quot;The king expresses his gratitude with an undercurrent of disdain.&quot; or &quot;The bandit threatens you with no trace of reason in his eyes.&quot; You can choose to respond however you see fit, by threatening, cajoling, warmly thanking, etc. to influence character&#x27;s perceptions, attitudes, and ultimately actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes and actions would bubble upward as well to influence cities and kingdoms. If the player was not currently in a city it could be simulated on a macro level rather than each individual character in the city, so that the city&#x27;s influence and politics would change and existing characters in the city would have their life stories altered without the need for a granular simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to work through the details of the system, and see what implementation issues I run into, but this should provide a base for further development in a new and exciting direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve started work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;. The prototype is not yet a functioning game, but there is a command processing system and the basis of a generic game engine capable of singleplayer and multiplayer text-based gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>CDDA big world showcase: Ernie&#x27;s great road trip</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;The city size and city spacing settings for this CDDA world&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/cdda_ernie_map_world.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like road trips through the post apocalyptic rural wasteland, I&#x27;ve got the right &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt; world generation settings for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City size of 16 makes absolutely huge metropolises, and city spacing 8 places these massive cities far apart, producing some amazing travel experiences. Normal generation is reather unrealistic with plenty of tiny towns close together, but with these settings getting between cities basically requires a car, and simulates the long abandoned highways you&#x27;d expect in a New England apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my latest playthrough, my character Ernie drives in his sports car across the New England countryside for an entire day on his way to the refugee center, with not a single city in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../videos/cdda_ernie_map.webm&quot; preload controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of interesting landmarks and happenings along the way, and lots of little rural gas stations for topping off the tanks and grabbing preserved food. This kind of travel was actually relaxing: 100 mph down straight stretches of highway. Just need to avoid all the abandoned and wrecked cars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Ernie settled down in the hunting lodge north of the refugee center, but there&#x27;ll be a lot more road trips in the future as Ernie builds a new life in this huge apocalyptic world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>30th DCSS win: Octopode Cinder Acolyte of Jiyva</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I successfully ascended with my 30th win in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; roguelike, playing an Octopode Cinder Acolyte of Jiyva. This was a really fun run, relying on Statue Form and Dragon&#x27;s Call by the end. Dragon&#x27;s Call, in particular, seems like one of the most powerful, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most powerful, spells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.kelbi.org/crawl/morgue/Nornya/morgue-Nornya-20230329-020302.txt&quot;&gt;morgue file&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.kelbi.org&quot;&gt;CKO&lt;/a&gt; is included below:

	<title>Erik Otto #5: Gaining allies</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploration&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before any high-level raiding, Erik wants more allies and resources. There is no more postal service or Amazon, so he goes exploring with Alejandro Quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/exploring.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up around the big city should be rich pickings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/turret%20car.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s an armored car along the side of the road with two turrets mounted on top. Erik and Alejandro pull over beside it and strip out the turrets for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;These turret mounts are the first step in a fully-automated laser defense system mounted on top of a vehicle. Such defenses would make raiding cities almost a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/battle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik and Alejandro tear through a horde of zombies with 5.56 NATO rounds as they raid another evacuation shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/southwick.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a map they found on one of the zombie&#x27;s body, Erik learns about another city to the north-east. This&#x27;s one&#x27;s smaller, but no less dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/tower.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik climbs a radio tower to survey the surrounding area. There&#x27;s plenty of useful stores in the city, and some interesting features in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/bunker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and Alejandro come across a survivor&#x27;s bunker surrounded by spiked pits. They don&#x27;t have any way to get across, so they leave it, but maybe there was something good in there, or even a survivor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gertha&quot;&gt;Gertha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/scavenger.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they drive across a field, they come across a survivor: a scavenger. She&#x27;s tough-looking, and Erik decides to recruit her into the cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/yay.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She accepts! Gertha Solano joins the team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/gertha%20abilities.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Gertha is a solid combat character. She has good melee skills, and amazing ranged skills, plus the excellent &lt;em&gt;Fast Learner&lt;/em&gt; trait which will help greatly in improving combat and non-combat skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/gertha%20camp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gertha packs up her makeshift camp and joins them in the back of the truck as they head to base to get Gertha geared up and settled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/gertha%20inv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gertha inheirits Erik&#x27;s position of primary explorer, and gets decked out with gear and weapons. Unlike Erik, she doesn&#x27;t care about fashion, so she sticks on a sturdy duster and Kevlar vest to be ready for any combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/faction%20camp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With three people in the cult now, Erik decides to set up a camp outside the bunker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;
	The faction camp system lets NPCs embark on longer tasks, fetch resources, and craft items. It takes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of resources to get faction camps up and running, so for now there&#x27;s just a tent for some shelter. Alejandro Quick can chop logs from the forest, for example, while the others are out exploring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/gun%20basement.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an exploration trip in one of the Southwick houses, Gertha finds a gun basement with plenty of guns and ammunition. She uses a heavy crowbar to smash apart the ammunition safes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Erik drives them to the refugee center, where they learn about some kind of scientific hub left after the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/hub01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s very far to the south, but the refugee leader wants them to deliver a packet of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/bandits.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, Gertha takes their sniper rifle between the pickup seats and takes out a camp of bandits from range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/dead%20bandits.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those bandits weren&#x27;t even dangerous. Not since Gertha had a rifle that powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/person%20spotted.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kathy&quot;&gt;Kathy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While driving down toward the scientific hub, they spot signs of life in a little swamp shack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/kathy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s another person! Kathy Burroughs, another survivor, agrees to join the gang. She&#x27;s in excellent physical condition, even stronger than Gertha, so she&#x27;ll be a valuable asset on the exploration team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/raiding%20cabin.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While raiding a bandit cabin, Gertha engages in close quarters rifle combat. She hides out of sign, training her aim on doorways, and when a hapless bandit charges out she guns him down with no more than a squeeze of her trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/hub01_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally they reach the scientific hub, Hub 01.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/intercom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s an intercom in the main building, but nobody alive upstairs. After some back-and-forth with the person on the other side of the intercom, Erik gets enough favor to begin accepting mercenary missions and traiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/intercom%20trade.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hub 01 trades good books, armor, weapons, and scientific items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;domenic&quot;&gt;Domenic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/domenic.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing cries of help from a cabin on an exploration trip, Gertha and Kathy fight through a horde of zombies to rescue Domenic Driver. He agrees to join their group without Erik even present. The cult is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/domenic%20stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domenic is not very strong, but he&#x27;s an unarmed combat master. In the future, perhaps, he can teach the rest of them. For now he&#x27;ll be stuck on camp duty after getting geared up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turret&quot;&gt;Laser turret&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Hub 01 missions left the group with an &lt;em&gt;hm12 dazzle rifle&lt;/em&gt;, a weak but cheap laser weapon that damages even robots. Erik wants to mount it on the pickup truck with automatic targetting, so he reads plenty of books to design a turret and turret controller system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/getting%20bots.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also retrive some broken riot control turrets that Erik shot up earlier, to strip them for parts and AI cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/installed%20turret.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally Erik installs the automated laser turret on the pickup truck. This will target and destroy anything hostile it sees, and greatly improves the teams offensive and defensive power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/5/lab%20target.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop: a top-secret scientific lab sitting in the middle of a giant ant nest to the north-west.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Erik Otto #4: Arsenal</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With lockpicks in hand, Erik drives out to the wind turbines to pick their locks and survey the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/picking_lock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes him nearly the whole day to pick one of the locks, stopping to eat cake and drink water for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/picked_lock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
	Finally! He picks the lock, and at the same time gains proficiency in picking locks, which will make the other wind turbines much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/new_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After climbing to the top, he gains a wide view of the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading to the next wind turbine, Erik decides to complete the mission given by Smokes the refugee center merchant and clear out their back bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/clearing_back_bay.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, he pulls back a locker, opens the solid door, and a flood of zombies comes stumbling at him with outstretched arms. Erik pulls back and lets the strong guards with sturdy stone spears take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/cleared_back_bay.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle was bloody, but only zombies died. Erik collected his reward from Smokes: a bunch of refugee center money known as &quot;merch&quot; by the Free Merchants faction who ran the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/new_mission.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also received a new mission: to find and eliminate a gang of bandits preying on Free Merchants caravans. This would be extremely dangerous, if these bandits had guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/more_map2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, Erik picked his way into two more wind turbines and found even more of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/mansion.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a big mansion to the north of the last turbine, so Erik and Alejandro went to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/firefighting.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Alejandro guarded the pickup, Erik lit some fires and taunted zombies into the flames, stabbing at them with his combat knife. He didn&#x27;t make it far into the mansion, but there was still some good loot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/hiking%20backpacks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two hiking backpacks, some of the best packs ever sold. Erik quickly made these his and Alejandro&#x27;s standard kit pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/another.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He converted his old rucksack into another standard kit for the next member of his team, whenever he found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/npc_wood.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at base, Erik decided he needed a fence for his cows. He had Alejandro chop down trees and cut them into planks, while he went on the hunt for nails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/burned_down.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik burned down a moonshine still through the night, and tool the nails out of the dust and rubble left afterward. He needed lots of nails for this fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/fence.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the next day, Erik and Alejandro had built a fence for their four cows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/22%20silent.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik&#x27;s next move was to raid some libraries, to get enough books to craft advanced items and build better cars. The problem was combat in a city: Erik didn&#x27;t want to resort to melee combat for fear of injury, and guns were too loud. However, a suppressed .22 caliber rifle was as quiet as footsteps, and powerful enough to take down even tough zombies. Erik grabbed a pocket full of ammunition and his suppressed Marlin 39A and went off library raiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/library1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first library, down to the southwest of his base, yielded some useful books, though it was severely torn up. His silenced .22 rifle tore through zombies without them even noticing him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/library2%20map.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second library, up in the huge city, proved to be just as easy a raid, though it too had been vandalized and many of the books rendered unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/books.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik brought the books back to base with a good feeling in his heart. They would be very useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/fridge%20and%20freezer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also retrieved another freezer and a refrigerator from a bunker he and Alejandro had raided on the way. He didn&#x27;t turn the freezer on yet, but the fridge would be very useful for storing cow milk for him and Alejandro to drink for the calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/military%20outpost.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his exploration, Erik had noticed a small military outpost. It didn&#x27;t look too occupied, and would have valuable ammunition, so he and Alejandro went on a raid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/dermatiks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shot down a cloud of huge ovipositing wasps, then broke into the outpost with little resistance. One C-4 explosion later, and they carted home more than 2000 rounds of 5.56 NATO ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/4/ammo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this arsenal, Erik and Alejandro were ready to begin focusing on further goals: electric hybrid cars, automated laser turrets, and raiding top-secret science laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Erik Otto #3: Preparing for battle</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the base is set up, Erik can start more organized exploration and raids. To manage having a large number of followers&amp;#8212;when he gets them&amp;#8212;he needs to set up stations for people to suit up and suit down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gear&quot;&gt;Organizing gear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/washboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Erik crafts a washing kit and washes up some holsters and sheaths he took off zombie corpses while raiding light industry compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/clothes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full outfits go into the clothes room. Currently there isn&#x27;t much difference, but in the future there may be full hazmat outfits, melee raiding outfits, summer outfits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/weapons.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons&amp;#8212;including slings, holsters, sheaths, and the like&amp;#8212;go into the weapons side of this room. Weapons racks should include a gun and a backup melee weapon. In the future there&#x27;ll be sidearms and rifles in every rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/gear.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the racks in this half of the room hold backpacks filled with supplies. The backpacks all contain vital tools, like flashlights, multitools, lighters, and prying tools. Eventually the tools will become standardized, but for now there is a little variance between the tools, though they all provide mostly the same capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/mission_pack.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the counters in the workshop are for mission packs, sets of items needed for various missions. Anyone can grab one of these and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploring&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik takes the pickup truck out for an exploration spin to scout more of the area and collect useful loot.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/ranch.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up near the huge city, Erik finds a ranch with a gas station nearby. The city filled with zombies is uncomfortably close, but he makes sure to stay out of dead earshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/steam%20tractor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a steam-powered tractor in the barn. Not really useful, but perhaps a time will come when coal is more plentiful than gas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/gas%20station.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet, however. Erik fills up his pickup truck with gasoline from the pump. It&#x27;s still working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/old%20van.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The van he and Alejandro found back when the first left the evac shelter still has gas in it. Erik takes the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/new%20lamp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, Erik installs a new standing lamp to light up the rest of the storage areas, then heads out for more exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/shooting%20zapper.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A zapper zombie guards a fire lookout tower. Erik guns it down with a single bullet, then goes up into the tower to survey the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/more%20map.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing much that&#x27;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weapons&quot;&gt;Weaponry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the guns and ammunition that he has, Erik decides it&#x27;s time to take on the military helipad to the east, looking for more fuel, ammunition, and explosives.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/helipad.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helipad itself is a small military base, very accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/helipad%20fuel.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also got plenty of fuel, for when Erik converts some of his vehicles to be diesel/electric hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/zombie%20dog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A zombie dog attacks Erik from within an abandoned cabin. It bites his leg deeply before he shoots it to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/alcohol%20wip.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a problem; Erik uses some alcohol wipes to disinfect his wound and keeps going. He can&#x27;t wait to gather more followers so he doesn&#x27;t have to do this himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/hiding.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military roadblocks with automated turrets are goldmines for ammunition and magazines, but the problem is the turrets. Erik devises a method shooting the turrets before they can even see him. He crouches in his truck to avoid line of sight and drives right next to the turret...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/pop%20out%20and%20shoot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...then he pops up to check where it is, ducks down again, pokes his rifle out the window...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/blam.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and &lt;strong&gt;BLAM&lt;/strong&gt;, there&#x27;s a dead turret. Rinse and repeat for the other turret, and for the other roadblocks in the area. Erik picks up 9mm pistol rounds as well as 5.56 NATO rifle rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/more%20map%202.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/more%20map%203.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik scouts still more of the area. He spots another Last Man On Earth bunker to the north, and investigates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/secret%20passage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one had a hidden passage behind a bookcase. Erik slides the bookcase out of the way and finds a cache of guns and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/lmoe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full bunker had a decent amount of supplies. Erik throws them all into his truck. Every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/military%20roadblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military roadblock near the original evac shelter is the next nut to crack. Erik approaches with a full rifle as the zombie soldiers are distracted by the turrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/boom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One battle later, and everything but Erik is dead. He might not want to get his hands dirty, but there is no fury like the wrath of a lazy man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/back.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returns with a haul of guns and ammunition to base, ready to sort it out with Alejandro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;return&quot;&gt;Return to base&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in the scouting phase is to break into some of the wind turbines to get an even broader view of the area. For this, Erik could either cut through the metal doors with an acetylene torch, which would be expensive, or he could craft some lockpicks and just spend a little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/workbenches.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sturdy workbenches looted from the helipad will make this easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../cdda_images/erik/3/lockpicks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik crafts a set of lockpicks with Alejandro&#x27;s help. It&#x27;s time for phase two of the scouting plan: wind turbine breaking and entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>
