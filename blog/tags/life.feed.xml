	<title>I graduated from MVNU!</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mvnu_grad_ribbon.png&quot; alt=&quot;ribbon cut just before the baccalaureate service&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from MVNU yesterday, &lt;i&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; Honors scholar! &lt;small&gt;I did it, an A in every class!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#x27;m really done&lt;/i&gt; hit me in a small way now that I can clean up all the academic files and folders and apps I have hanging around my computers. I don&#x27;t need my LMS anymore. Most of my hundreds of old assignments are worth as much as the paragraphs I wrote in 3rd grade. Notebooks filled with doodles and math homework are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the important things I started during my time at MVNU won&#x27;t stop just because I graduated. Projects like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;mapping tool&lt;/a&gt; and the creative writing work that I&#x27;ve done will continue, the dozens of good friends I&#x27;ve made are still my friends even now that we&#x27;ve gone our separate ways, and all the social and academic knowledge pounded into my head is solidly &lt;b&gt;there&lt;/b&gt;, ready for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
