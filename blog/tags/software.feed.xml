	<title>I took the ETS major field test for computer science</title>
	<description>Every senior student at MVNU takes a standardized assessment. The assessment lets MVNU administration compare how well their students are doing against other institutions, and how well each program is teaching the fundamentals of the program’s field. In my case the assessment was the ETS major field test for computer science. While I knew the test was coming up, I wasn’t given any information about what would be on the test, and since I knew it wouldn’t affect my graduation or GPA I wasn’t particularly concerned about studying for it. The day before the testing day I decided to look…</description>

	<title>Debugging slow boot and a clogged router</title>
	<description>I powered on my laptop yesterday morning and saw the Ubuntu boot had stalled on two systemd services: trying to mount a disk by UUID, with a 90 second timeout, and waiting for the network to come up, with no timeout. Before the 90 seconds for mounting the disk was up, the boot continued and I got to the graphical login menu. Network manager tried to connect to my friends’ home Wi-Fi, but the connection failed. This was odd: I had never seen these messages before during boot. I had not installed or upgraded new software for several days. I…</description>

	<title>Mapping tool 0.6 release</title>
	<description>I’m proud to release version 0.6 of the mapping tool: the picture and performance update! You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo Once you’ve tested the new version, please fill out the feedback survey. Picture and Performance Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements–far less jerking the map around–as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more. New features and fixes include: The ability to extend and merge existing map objects. Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you’re drawing on or panning over the map.

	<title>Autodrive into a crater fix</title>
	<description>In my current Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead playthrough, I ran into a problem with the autodrive feature: it’d drive me straight into a crater and crash the vehicle. This seemed like a straightforward fix, so I checked out the master branch and set about debugging. Autodrive definitely has the capability to avoid certain terrain, so I guessed it was just a mistake in how it was calculating ledge traps or open air terrain. Sure enough, it was just an error in how the vehicle was being considered as “able to drive over air”. With the existing logic, autodrive thought every…</description>

	<title>Raymon Ortega #3: Camping out of town</title>
	<description>First Night Raymon needs more supplies. He’d like a map of the area; extra food is good; tools would be useful. It’s almost nightfall; he’s spent the whole day traveling toward the refugee center, but now he’s stuck just outside a city of unknown dimensions. The zombies can’t see very far at night, so Raymon plans to raid some of the houses for supplies as soon as nightfall comes. It’s time to set up camp. His camp is barebones, just a tent and a car, but it’s better than nothing. The tent ensures no zombies (or aliens, for that matter)…</description>
