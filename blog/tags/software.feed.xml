	<title>Debugging slow boot and a clogged router</title>
	<description>I powered on my laptop yesterday morning and saw the Ubuntu boot had stalled on two systemd services: trying to mount a disk by UUID, with a 90 second timeout, and waiting for the network to come up, with no timeout. Before the 90 seconds for mounting the disk was up, the boot continued and I got to the graphical login menu. Network manager tried to connect to my friends’ home Wi-Fi, but the connection failed. This was odd: I had never seen these messages before during boot. I had not installed or upgraded new software for several days. I…</description>

	<title>Mapping tool 0.6 release</title>
	<description>I’m proud to release version 0.6 of the mapping tool: the picture and performance update! You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo Once you’ve tested the new version, please fill out the feedback survey. Picture and Performance Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements–far less jerking the map around–as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more. New features and fixes include: The ability to extend and merge existing map objects. Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you’re drawing on or panning over the map. Greatly…</description>

	<title>Autodrive into a crater fix</title>
	<description>In my current Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead playthrough, I ran into a problem with the autodrive feature: it’d drive me straight into a crater and crash the vehicle. This seemed like a straightforward fix, so I checked out the master branch and set about debugging. Autodrive definitely has the capability to avoid certain terrain, so I guessed it was just a mistake in how it was calculating ledge traps or open air terrain. Sure enough, it was just an error in how the vehicle was being considered as “able to drive over air”. With the existing logic, autodrive thought every…</description>

	<title>More RSS feeds!</title>
	<description>I’ve added more RSS feeds, one for each blog tag. This allows people to subscribe to only, say, the mappingtool tag. I can, in this way, use my blog easily as a set of smaller blogs for each category. This took just a bit of work in the website build script; and I cleaned it up a bit so it doesn’t commit temporary files and doesn’t need to work so hard to find the root of the website when I’m already passing that information in the script. I do need to refactor it more, it’s getting rather unwieldy, though still…</description>

	<title>I'm on diff.blog</title>
	<description>I saw yesterday that diff.blog’s bot account on Github had starred the repository for this website. I clicked through to their Github page, which described diff.blog as an aggregator of developer blogs… started in 2019 to improve the visibility of self hosted blogs. I followed the directions in their README and signed in to diff.blog with my Github account. Once there, I added the URL of my blog to my account settings and diff.blog crawled my RSS feed. Once I saw how it was using the RSS item descriptions to generate summaries, I improved my build script to actually generate…</description>

	<title>I made an RSS feed!</title>
	<description>I made an RSS feed for my blog! It’s a really simple format; I was able to implement my feed just by following the RSS 2.0 spec. Of course, RSS readers are a little less common than they were a decade ago; but there are plenty of extensions for Firefox—I’m using RSSPreview just to test the feed—and with how easy it was to extend my blog generator to generate XML alongside HTML I figured it was better to have a feed than not.…</description>

	<description>Hello all! Here’s version 0.5 of the mapping tool! You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo Once you’ve tested the new version, please fill out the feedback survey. You can click everything now! One of the primary bits of feedback I received was for a better user interface, and version 0.5 now has a full palette sidebar so that every single control is clickable instead of needing to use the keyboard for everything! The big blob of help text is also much reduced; there are labels, icons, and/or buttons for everything and you…</description>

	<title>benleskey.com build script</title>
	<description>This website is static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a build script that compiles together templates and HTML into the final website that you see, this bit of dynamicism enables me to reuse common HTML and keeps track of tedious bits like blog tag link lists. The script—as of writing—that compiles the website is fully commented and included below, along with the data file listing all the blog posts. build.sh posts.sh build.sh posts.sh…</description>
