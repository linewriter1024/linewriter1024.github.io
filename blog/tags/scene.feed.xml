	<title>Scene draft: Lusha tries to get answers, version 2</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the second draft of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/lusha_answers_version_1&quot;&gt;scene I&#x27;ve been working on&lt;/a&gt;, both for my creative writing class and for my current novel project. I&#x27;ve made some revisions to make it more clear what&#x27;s going on, and I removed the bit at the end of having a random rat run up and eat the telephone cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Lusha?&amp;#8221; Her father&#x27;s soft voice came metallic and worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba, I need to know something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#x27;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What is it, love?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did you get me to the university?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The briefest pause, then he said &amp;#8220;Is something wrong?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba&amp;#8212;!&amp;#8221; Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, &amp;#8220;Baba, something happened and I&amp;#8217;ve gotta know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wanna know. I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened, Lusha?&amp;#8221; He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat in their kitchen with a stool on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is that Lusha, Eli?&amp;#8221; her mothers voice came through the line. &amp;#8220;Oh, Lusha, what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was asking how I got to&amp;#8230; here,&amp;#8221; said Lusha, glancing at the girl beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh,&amp;#8221; said her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s nothing,&amp;#8221; said her father. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are you gonna tell her?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;ll be okay. It&amp;#8217;s okay. You can go back to the bread.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have to yet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s wrong?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He won&amp;#8217;t tell me either.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business too,&amp;#8221; said Lusha. The girl next to her was chatting about foot sores with her friend. Lusha gritted her teeth. &amp;#8220;I told you, something happened&amp;#8230; at the registrar. An important man asked me for something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to talk,&amp;#8221; he said, just like when she was a kid being scolded. &amp;#8220;Later.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t talk later. I won&amp;#8217;t have a telephone. We need to talk now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry love,&amp;#8221; he choked out, &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can&amp;#8217;t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can&amp;#8217;t tell just me? Eli?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t have to say what it is. Just say there&amp;#8217;s something. Don&amp;#8217;t look at me like that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your father&amp;#8217;s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha weighed her words. &amp;#8220;Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want him to say it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma please. I don&amp;#8217;t have any time.&amp;#8221; Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn&amp;#8217;t hung up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eli, say it. Just say you&amp;#8217;re hiding it! Say what you did to get her into the university!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father choked out a guttural sob. &amp;#8220;Girls, please&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221; The handset was too heavy. The girl beside her was too quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. &amp;#8220;He ran out the door.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is he okay?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you know? I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want you to come home first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not over the telephone. Not over the telephone, Lusha.&amp;#8221; Now she was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. &amp;#8220;Moma,&amp;#8221; she whispered. The line popped as if it were cut, and hissed horribly. &amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; She pulled the crackling, hissing roar away from her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bored girl stood behind her. &amp;#8220;You done?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha sniffled and handed over the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Scene draft: Lusha tries to get answers, version 1</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/lusha_answers_version_2&quot;&gt;second draft.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first draft of a scene I&#x27;ll be using much later. I wrote it for a creative writing class prompt, as it fit the prompt of having characters unable to say what they really mean. It&#x27;s a bit inspired by Hemingway&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Like_White_Elephants&quot;&gt;Hills Like White Elephants&lt;/a&gt; since I read that just before writing this, and the prompt itself leads along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones in her ear. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Lusha?&amp;#8221; Her father&#x27;s soft voice came metallic and worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba, I need to know something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#x27;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What is it, love?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did you get me to the university?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The briefest pause, then he said &amp;#8220;Is something wrong?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba&amp;#8212;!&amp;#8221; Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, &amp;#8220;Baba, something happened and I&amp;#8217;ve gotta know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wanna know. I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened, Lusha?&amp;#8221; He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat on their living room table with a chair on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is that Lusha, Eli?&amp;#8221; her mothers voice came through the line. &amp;#8220;Oh, Lusha, what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was asking how I got to&amp;#8230; here,&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh,&amp;#8221; said her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s nothing,&amp;#8221; said her father. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are you gonna tell her?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;ll be okay. It&amp;#8217;s okay. You can go back to the bread.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have to yet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s wrong?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He won&amp;#8217;t tell me either.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business too,&amp;#8221; said Lusha. &amp;#8220;I told you, something happened.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to talk,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Later.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t talk later. I won&amp;#8217;t have a telephone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry love, I can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can&amp;#8217;t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can&amp;#8217;t tell just me? Eli?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t have to say what it is. Just say there&amp;#8217;s something. Don&amp;#8217;t look at me like that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your father&amp;#8217;s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha weighed her words. &amp;#8220;Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want him to say it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma please. I don&amp;#8217;t have any time.&amp;#8221; Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn&amp;#8217;t hung up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eli, say it. Just say you&amp;#8217;re hiding it!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father choked out a guttural sob. &amp;#8220;Girls, please&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221; The handset was too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. &amp;#8220;He ran out the door.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is he okay?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you know? I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want you to come home first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not over the telephone.&amp;#8221; Now she was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. &amp;#8220;Moma,&amp;#8221; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big commotion came over the telephone. &amp;#8220;Eugh! There&amp;#8217;s a rat chew&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221; the line went flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey Lusha,&amp;#8221; said the girl next to her, &amp;#8220;Is everything alright?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha couldn&amp;#8217;t say.&lt;/p&gt;
