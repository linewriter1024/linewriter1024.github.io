	<title>Mapping tool 0.6 release</title>
	<description>I’m proud to release version 0.6 of the mapping tool: the picture and performance update! You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo Once you’ve tested the new version, please fill out the feedback survey. Picture and Performance Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements–far less jerking the map around–as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more. New features and fixes include: The ability to extend and merge existing map objects. Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you’re drawing on or panning over the map. Greatly…</description>

	<title>Raymon Ortega #3: Camping out of town</title>
	<description>First Night Raymon needs more supplies. He’d like a map of the area; extra food is good; tools would be useful. It’s almost nightfall; he’s spent the whole day traveling toward the refugee center, but now he’s stuck just outside a city of unknown dimensions. The zombies can’t see very far at night, so Raymon plans to raid some of the houses for supplies as soon as nightfall comes. It’s time to set up camp. His camp is barebones, just a tent and a car, but it’s better than nothing. The tent ensures no zombies (or aliens, for that matter)…</description>
