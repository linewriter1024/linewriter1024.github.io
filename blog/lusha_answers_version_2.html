			<p>Here's the second draft of a <a href="lusha_answers_version_1">scene I've been working on</a>, both for my creative writing class and for my current novel project. I've made some revisions to make it more clear what's going on, and I removed the bit at the end of having a random rat run up and eat the telephone cord.</p>

<h2>Scene</h2>
<p>Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lusha?&#8221; Her father's soft voice came metallic and worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baba, I need to know something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn't say anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baba?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get me to the university?&#8221;</p>
<p>The briefest pause, then he said &#8220;Is something wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Baba&#8212;!&#8221; Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, &#8220;Baba, something happened and I&#8217;ve gotta know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanna know. I have to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened, Lusha?&#8221; He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat in their kitchen with a stool on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Lusha, Eli?&#8221; her mothers voice came through the line. &#8220;Oh, Lusha, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was asking how I got to&#8230; here,&#8221; said Lusha, glancing at the girl beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you gonna tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be okay. It&#8217;s okay. You can go back to the bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; said Lusha.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t tell me either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business too,&#8221; said Lusha. The girl next to her was chatting about foot sores with her friend. Lusha gritted her teeth. &#8220;I told you, something happened&#8230; at the registrar. An important man asked me for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to talk,&#8221; he said, just like when she was a kid being scolded. &#8220;Later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk later. I won&#8217;t have a telephone. We need to talk now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry love,&#8221; he choked out, &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can&#8217;t tell just me? Eli?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to say what it is. Just say there&#8217;s something. Don&#8217;t look at me like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moma?&#8221; said Lusha.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lusha weighed her words. &#8220;Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want him to say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moma please. I don&#8217;t have any time.&#8221; Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn&#8217;t hung up yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eli, say it. Just say you&#8217;re hiding it! Say what you did to get her into the university!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father choked out a guttural sob. &#8220;Girls, please&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Baba?&#8221; The handset was too heavy. The girl beside her was too quiet.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. &#8220;He ran out the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know? I have to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to come home first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not over the telephone. Not over the telephone, Lusha.&#8221; Now she was crying.</p>
<p>Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. &#8220;Moma,&#8221; she whispered. The line popped as if it were cut, and hissed horribly. &#8220;Moma?&#8221; She pulled the crackling, hissing roar away from her head.</p>
<p>Another bored girl stood behind her. &#8220;You done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lusha sniffled and handed over the telephone.</p>
