	<title>Mapping tool 0.6.2 release & thanks to all testers</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for supporting the development of the mapping tool with your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.6.2 of the mapping tool is out, with several important improvements including unlimited scale and image exporting. This is the last version of the mapping tool to be developed as an MVNU project, as I have graduated! In the future, the mapping tool will be developed as an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download it here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the online demo here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/demo&quot;&gt;https://mapper1024.github.io/demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.2.thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the sample map in the mapping tool&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;image-exporting&quot;&gt;Image Exporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now save parts of the map as images to be used as illustrations for a book, for a website, or for whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unlimited-scale&quot;&gt;Unlimited Scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of your maps is now unlimited, with a few handy controls to set exactly what scale you want to edit your map at at any given moment: you can edit on the scale of meters to design a city, or on the scale of hundreds of kilometers to design a continent. Whatever you like, all in the same map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I graduated doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the mapping tool is done. I&amp;#8217;m going to keep working on it! Features like altitude controls, better performance, alternate graphical styles, and more are all in the pipeline. I&amp;#8217;ll also be releasing the tool as an open source project so that anyone interested can contribute ideas, code, and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-in-touch&quot;&gt;Stay in Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to e-mail me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/mailto:ben@benleskey.com&quot;&gt;ben@benleskey.com&lt;/a&gt; for anything! You can also post feature requests or bug reports using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/issues&quot;&gt;mapping tool issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to keep up with development of the mapping tool and try out new releases, all mapping tool news is posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/aka/mappingtoolnews&quot;&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/tags/mappingtool.feed.xml&quot;&gt;rss feed for news&lt;/a&gt; is available, as well as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/releases.atom&quot;&gt;atom feed for releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support, and I hope you continue to enjoy the mapping tool as it grows and evolves!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>I graduated from MVNU!</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mvnu_grad_ribbon.png&quot; alt=&quot;ribbon cut just before the baccalaureate service&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from MVNU yesterday, &lt;i&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; Honors scholar! &lt;small&gt;I did it, an A in every class!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#x27;m really done&lt;/i&gt; hit me in a small way now that I can clean up all the academic files and folders and apps I have hanging around my computers. I don&#x27;t need my LMS anymore. Most of my hundreds of old assignments are worth as much as the paragraphs I wrote in 3rd grade. Notebooks filled with doodles and math homework are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the important things I started during my time at MVNU won&#x27;t stop just because I graduated. Projects like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;mapping tool&lt;/a&gt; and the creative writing work that I&#x27;ve done will continue, the dozens of good friends I&#x27;ve made are still my friends even now that we&#x27;ve gone our separate ways, and all the social and academic knowledge pounded into my head is solidly &lt;b&gt;there&lt;/b&gt;, ready for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Prototype post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator for the Minetest engine</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&#x27;ve begun work on a game project, smaller in scope and more relaxing than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/textengine_intro&quot;&gt;text engine project&lt;/a&gt;. This new project uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; engine for voxel graphics, entities, and physics. This game, Roadtrip, is designed along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017180/The_Long_Drive/&quot;&gt;The Long Drive&lt;/a&gt; as a post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator and also takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt;. It&#x27;s written in Lua.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/roadtrip.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../thumbs/roadtrip.25.png&quot; alt=&quot;roadtrip game prototype&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minetest&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Voxels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine provides a solid base for this type of game: procedural generation, low-poly graphics, built-in multiplayer, etc. I have quite a bit of experience with Minetest and Lua, so it&#x27;s a good choice for game engine since I don&#x27;t want to put too much development effort into this game. The world will consist of &quot;voxels&quot;, blocks like in Minecraft that form the terrain, along with moveable &quot;entities&quot; such as the vehicles and the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic design of the game is the player driving down a road in a procedurally generated environment. The player must survive (food, water, gasoline/electricity, shelter, etc.) as long as possible while enjoying the view and trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like The Long Drive, Roadtrip will have a long highway extending indefinitely into the distance with a randomly generated environment surrounding it, maybe including side roads or broader road networks. The prototype environment will be a desert, but it will be easy to add new biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the prototype, the road runs from the south toward the north, with turns and corners defined by an equation that returns the X (east-west) coordinate of the road based on the Z (north-south) coordinate. The current equation is defined as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code language=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;local z_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()
local z_factor_2 = 160 + 160 * seed_random()
local x_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()

local function road_x(z)
	return math.floor(math.sin(z / z_factor) * (math.sin(z / z_factor_2) ^ 4) * x_factor + 0.5)
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; where &lt;em&gt;seed_random()&lt;/em&gt; is a random generator returning a random number between 0 and 1 according to the world seed. All other properties of the world, like the width of the road at any point, will be defined by similar procedural generation to ensure continuity as each chunk of the map is generated separately.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vehicles&quot;&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicles are the focus of Roadtrip, so they will be very customizable. Vehicles will be individual components internally, such as the chassis, the wheels, the doors, etc., which can then be installed together and the models attached to display an entire car, truck, or other vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;survival&quot;&gt;Survival&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survival elements including hunger, thirst, weather, and fuel will drive further exploration and resource gathering. There may be enemies as well, or some other active threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploration&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources will be available in structures off the road, in abandoned cars, or from natural resources like lakes or trees. This will encourage exploration off road, both with and without a vehicle. Terrain generation can be improved to have hills, valleys, caves, etc. to spice up the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Development Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine is limited in a number of ways that will make development more challenging. I do think my familiarity with the engine along the engine&#x27;s simplicity will make it worth it, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rotation&quot;&gt;Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most noticably, if the player is attached to an object and the object rotates, the player&#x27;s viewport does not rotate with the object. My workaround, rotating both at the same time, suffers from network lag causing noticable drift that the player must manually correct. I may need to contribute a feature to the engine to support this for more realistic driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collision&quot;&gt;Collision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For performance reasons, an object&#x27;s collisionbox cannot extend much beyond ~3 nodes in any direction before it starts to break. This means that entities like vehicles can&#x27;t be too big or their physics won&#x27;t work. Again, I may need to improve the engine here, or just live with innacurate collision on large vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hud&quot;&gt;Hud &amp;amp; Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the HUD and controls is a bit of a challenge as the Minetest engine is geared toward a Minecraft-like game. Nevertheless, I should be able to represent the dashboard on the HUD nearly as easily as the player&#x27;s own stats. Controls are also a little harder, with a limited number of keybinds available to the game. I can use movement keys for driving, and I may be able to use hotbar items for actions like shifting gears or quick access of weapons or tools.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>First place prize for my mapping tool presentation at MVNU's sURC</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mapper_gifs_gif.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mapper_gifs_gif_small.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A map being drawn in the mapping tool&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2023-04-25: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvnu.edu/news/mvnu-students-shine-during-symposium-for-undergraduate-research-and-creative-works&quot;&gt;MVNU sURC press release featuring my mapping tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;Mapping Tool&lt;/a&gt; for fifteen minutes at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvnu.edu/undergraduate/academics/honorsprogram/surc&quot;&gt;MVNU&#x27;s &lt;abbr title=&quot;Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creative Work&quot;&gt;sURC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on April 5th, taking home the first place prize of the Symposium. My friends and faculty showed up en masse at my presentation, making for a lively Q&amp;amp;A and a really fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sURC itself was interesting. There were around twenty presenters in total. The Honors students presented their senior projects and other students presented their summer research projects in a conference format. In my room we had a wide variety of presentations: an analysis of continuous glucose monitors in diabetic patients, a presentation of a concussion-detecting device for athletes, an examination of religion and spirituality in occupational therapy, and my own software project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sURC presentation was my presentation for the Honors program portion of my project, so in it I focused on how user feedback shaped the development of the mapping tool with an overview of project features and the development process. Later I&#x27;ll have a twenty-five minute presentation on the details of programming and engineering the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the mapping tool, including download links and a quick-start guide, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;the mapping tool website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/mapper_gifs&quot;&gt;More about how I made the GIFs&lt;/a&gt; used in the presentation.)&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Toward the ultimate text adventure game engine</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-adventures&quot;&gt;Text adventure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-text&quot;&gt;Why text?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Text-based games have an extremely good &lt;em&gt;complexity/development time&lt;/em&gt; ratio. There are no graphics to worry about, no programmer art beyond writing (what luck, I happen to enjoy writing), no controls beyond text processing, no frames per second, et cetera, et cetera. Fully text based games can be even more complex than turn-based 2D roguelike games like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org/&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: DDA&lt;/a&gt;. There&#x27;s just less extra to worry about&amp;#8212;the development focus has one of the most basic interfaces imaginable. Additionally, fully text-based games are perfect for screen readers due to their simple interface (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing-games.com/building-a-better-mud/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about writing a screen-reader friendly text-based game).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The specific style of text-based game I&#x27;m talking about is the text adventure game. The computer tells you about your environment, your circumstances, and your character, and you choose what your character does or says. It&#x27;s simple, straightforward, and very reminiscent of the conversational style of a tabletop RPG.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, a human game master will always be better than a computer here, right? A human game master can simulate any situation, can mediate any conflict, can act any character. (I exaggerate, but not very much.) A computer must be programmed to handle every specific situation in the game&#x27;s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai&quot;&gt;AI?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can make &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; play a roleplaying game with you. ChatGPT can be the game master, simulate the environment, accept the actions of your character, whatever you might want. A couple of pitfalls prevent full immersion, however. ChatGPT forgets details and must be reminded, and it can&#x27;t stay on track with a game system, being a more freeform storyteller. I want something better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;muds&quot;&gt;MUDs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The system I have in mind is similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MUD&amp;amp;oldid=1140275602&quot;&gt;MUD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@williamson.f93/multi-user-dungeons-muds-what-are-they-and-how-to-play-af3ec0f29f4a&quot;&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing-games.com/what-is-a-mud-multi-user-dungeon/&quot;&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;, which is fully text-based as you pilot your character through a multiplayer world. MUDs are, however, limited in a number of ways: they are generally room based, their multiplayer nature requires real-time interaction, their systems are quite gamey, and the &quot;dungeon master&quot; is primarily concerned with combat mechanics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;something-new&quot;&gt;Something new&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve started work on a new system at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;text engine&lt;/em&gt; is an effort toward building a flexible text-based game engine for simulating any scenario or world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To simulate combat and action mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To handle social interactions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To keep track of world events: political affiliations, kingdom economics, famines, shipping routes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To support singleplayer play or play with a small party&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To support any genre of game: high fantasy action, low fantasy economic, sci-fi space battle, zombie apocalypse, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very ambitious goals, but the text engine format lends itself well to managing all this complexity without the added requirements of graphical display and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a long-term project, so development may be quite slow. There is no time pressure, however, so I can take it at my pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;go&quot;&gt;Learning Go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is also a way for me to learn the Go language, which has some unique syntax and ideas that I think will be perfect for a large text-based game engine like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic structure is thus: everything in the world, whether a city, a man, a kingdom, a sword, or a lake, is an entity in relationship with other entities, capable of whatever actions and interactions make sense for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s example a sample scenario to illustrate the idea: a covered &lt;b&gt;wagon&lt;/b&gt; of four &lt;b&gt;merchants&lt;/b&gt; traveling down a &lt;b&gt;road&lt;/b&gt; through a &lt;b&gt;forest&lt;/b&gt;, about to be robbed by two &lt;b&gt;bandits&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;crossbows&lt;/b&gt;. You are the lone &lt;b&gt;guard&lt;/b&gt; for the &lt;b&gt;wagon&lt;/b&gt;, wielding only a &lt;b&gt;sword&lt;/b&gt; riding in the &lt;b&gt;front&lt;/b&gt; with the &lt;b&gt;driver&lt;/b&gt; while the other three &lt;b&gt;merchants&lt;/b&gt; are sitting in the &lt;b&gt;back&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bold word in that previous paragrah would be an entity (or a few entities). As an example, the wagon is an entity with two entities making it up: the front and the back. In the event that you wanted to hide underneath the wagon, an entity for the underneath would be generated as well. The front of the wagon is an entity that &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; you and the driver. This &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; relationship would be mirrored by &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; relationships that you and the driver have with the wagon. The wagon itself is &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the road, while the road &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; the wagon. The road itself is within the forest, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the complex interactions that can happen here. Each of the merchants and bandits has an AI corresponding with their generated personalities and skills, so some of the merchants might draw weapons while others might seek cover in the wagon from the bandits&#x27; crowssbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue would be represented by ideas, such as &quot;The king expresses his gratitude with an undercurrent of disdain.&quot; or &quot;The bandit threatens you with no trace of reason in his eyes.&quot; You can choose to respond however you see fit, by threatening, cajoling, warmly thanking, etc. to influence character&#x27;s perceptions, attitudes, and ultimately actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes and actions would bubble upward as well to influence cities and kingdoms. If the player was not currently in a city it could be simulated on a macro level rather than each individual character in the city, so that the city&#x27;s influence and politics would change and existing characters in the city would have their life stories altered without the need for a granular simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to work through the details of the system, and see what implementation issues I run into, but this should provide a base for further development in a new and exciting direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve started work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&quot;&gt;https://github.com/linewriter1024/textengine&lt;/a&gt;. The prototype is not yet a functioning game, but there is a command processing system and the basis of a generic game engine capable of singleplayer and multiplayer text-based gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>CDDA big world showcase: Ernie's great road trip</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;The city size and city spacing settings for this CDDA world&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/cdda_ernie_map_world.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like road trips through the post apocalyptic rural wasteland, I&#x27;ve got the right &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt; world generation settings for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City size of 16 makes absolutely huge metropolises, and city spacing 8 places these massive cities far apart, producing some amazing travel experiences. Normal generation is reather unrealistic with plenty of tiny towns close together, but with these settings getting between cities basically requires a car, and simulates the long abandoned highways you&#x27;d expect in a New England apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my latest playthrough, my character Ernie drives in his sports car across the New England countryside for an entire day on his way to the refugee center, with not a single city in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../videos/cdda_ernie_map.webm&quot; preload controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of interesting landmarks and happenings along the way, and lots of little rural gas stations for topping off the tanks and grabbing preserved food. This kind of travel was actually relaxing: 100 mph down straight stretches of highway. Just need to avoid all the abandoned and wrecked cars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Ernie settled down in the hunting lodge north of the refugee center, but there&#x27;ll be a lot more road trips in the future as Ernie builds a new life in this huge apocalyptic world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>OBS Studio -> ffmpeg -> ImageMagick for an optimized gif</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update: The gifs worked! I &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/mvnu_surc&quot;&gt;successfully presented&lt;/a&gt; at sURC, and won the top prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been working on my presentation to present my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;mapping tool&lt;/a&gt; senior Honors project at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvnu.edu/undergraduate/academics/honorsprogram/surc&quot;&gt;MVNU&#x27;s &lt;abbr title=&quot;Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creative Work&quot;&gt;sURC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For part of this presentation I wanted an animated gif illustrating the basic drawing functionality of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot;&gt;OBS studio&lt;/a&gt; to record the actual video of me drawing a simple map. Then I imported the video into &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdenlive.org/&quot;&gt;Kdenlive&lt;/a&gt; for editing. OBS recorded the video as 1920x1080, but the actual mapping tool window that I was recording was only 1916x1008 so when I imported it into Kdenlive there was a black bar along the bottom. To solve this, I set the resolution of the Kdenlive project to 1278x672 (the same scale but a smaller resolution to keep the GIF size small) and applied a transform effect to position the original clip within the proper resolution. I set the clip speed to 300%, so that in under 30 seconds people could see an example of an entire (if small) map being created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Kdenlive project ready, I rendered it to an MP4 file for conversion to GIF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then converted the MP4 file using &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vf &quot;scale=-1:-1,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse&quot; -r 10 out.gif&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 10 fps struck a good balance between choppiness and size; I didn&#x27;t need it to be smooth, just not so jumpy as to be annoying. I had ffmpeg generate a GIF palette itself with the palettegen and paletteuse combo.
&lt;p&gt;Then I optimized the gif, lossily, using ImageMagick&#x27;s mogrify command &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mogrify -layers &#x27;optimize&#x27; -fuzz 7% out.gif&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final size of the optimized GIF was 3.1MiB, down from a 21MiB unoptimized GIF, an 8.1MiB MP4 file, and an 11MiB original obs output file.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here&#x27;s the final GIF:

	<title>Scene draft: Lusha tries to get answers, version 2</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the second draft of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/lusha_answers_version_1&quot;&gt;scene I&#x27;ve been working on&lt;/a&gt;, both for my creative writing class and for my current novel project. I&#x27;ve made some revisions to make it more clear what&#x27;s going on, and I removed the bit at the end of having a random rat run up and eat the telephone cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Lusha?&amp;#8221; Her father&#x27;s soft voice came metallic and worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba, I need to know something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#x27;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What is it, love?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did you get me to the university?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The briefest pause, then he said &amp;#8220;Is something wrong?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba&amp;#8212;!&amp;#8221; Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, &amp;#8220;Baba, something happened and I&amp;#8217;ve gotta know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wanna know. I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened, Lusha?&amp;#8221; He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat in their kitchen with a stool on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is that Lusha, Eli?&amp;#8221; her mothers voice came through the line. &amp;#8220;Oh, Lusha, what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was asking how I got to&amp;#8230; here,&amp;#8221; said Lusha, glancing at the girl beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh,&amp;#8221; said her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s nothing,&amp;#8221; said her father. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are you gonna tell her?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;ll be okay. It&amp;#8217;s okay. You can go back to the bread.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have to yet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s wrong?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He won&amp;#8217;t tell me either.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business too,&amp;#8221; said Lusha. The girl next to her was chatting about foot sores with her friend. Lusha gritted her teeth. &amp;#8220;I told you, something happened&amp;#8230; at the registrar. An important man asked me for something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to talk,&amp;#8221; he said, just like when she was a kid being scolded. &amp;#8220;Later.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t talk later. I won&amp;#8217;t have a telephone. We need to talk now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry love,&amp;#8221; he choked out, &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can&amp;#8217;t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can&amp;#8217;t tell just me? Eli?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t have to say what it is. Just say there&amp;#8217;s something. Don&amp;#8217;t look at me like that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your father&amp;#8217;s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha weighed her words. &amp;#8220;Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want him to say it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma please. I don&amp;#8217;t have any time.&amp;#8221; Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn&amp;#8217;t hung up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eli, say it. Just say you&amp;#8217;re hiding it! Say what you did to get her into the university!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father choked out a guttural sob. &amp;#8220;Girls, please&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221; The handset was too heavy. The girl beside her was too quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. &amp;#8220;He ran out the door.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is he okay?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you know? I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want you to come home first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not over the telephone. Not over the telephone, Lusha.&amp;#8221; Now she was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. &amp;#8220;Moma,&amp;#8221; she whispered. The line popped as if it were cut, and hissed horribly. &amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; She pulled the crackling, hissing roar away from her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bored girl stood behind her. &amp;#8220;You done?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha sniffled and handed over the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>30th DCSS win: Octopode Cinder Acolyte of Jiyva</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I successfully ascended with my 30th win in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; roguelike, playing an Octopode Cinder Acolyte of Jiyva. This was a really fun run, relying on Statue Form and Dragon&#x27;s Call by the end. Dragon&#x27;s Call, in particular, seems like one of the most powerful, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most powerful, spells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.kelbi.org/crawl/morgue/Nornya/morgue-Nornya-20230329-020302.txt&quot;&gt;morgue file&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.kelbi.org&quot;&gt;CKO&lt;/a&gt; is included below:

	<title>I took the ETS major field test for computer science</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Every senior student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvnu.edu&quot;&gt;MVNU&lt;/a&gt; takes a standardized assessment. The assessment lets MVNU administration compare how well their students are doing against other institutions, and how well each program is teaching the fundamentals of the program&#x27;s field. In my case the assessment was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ets.org/content/dam/ets-org/pdfs/mft/comp-sci-test-description.pdf&quot;&gt;ETS major field test for computer science&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	While I knew the test was coming up, I wasn&#x27;t given any information about what would be on the test, and since I knew it wouldn&#x27;t affect my graduation or GPA I wasn&#x27;t particularly concerned about studying for it. The day before the testing day I decided to look into exactly what I would be taking. I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ets.org/pdfs/mft/comp-sci-sample-questions.pdf&quot;&gt;sample questions document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230316163356/https://www.ets.org/pdfs/mft/comp-sci-sample-questions.pdf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;) by searching on google. These sample questions were representative of the actual test&amp;#8212;as one&#x27;d expect&amp;#8212;and there was nothing I hadn&#x27;t seen in my courses at MVNU. The bulk of the questions seemed to be more &quot;Computer Science&quot; than &quot;Computer Programming&quot; and were covered by two courses in particular that I&#x27;d taken: &lt;em&gt;Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithm Design&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Survey and Organization of Programming Languages&lt;/em&gt;. I didn&#x27;t study much beyond checking out the sample questions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	On the day of the actual test classes were cancelled for everyone to let seniors take their major field assessments, juniors take their general education assessments (only every other junior class has to take these, I didn&#x27;t have to last year), and everyone except graduating seniors to meet with their advisors and schedule classes for the next year. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get to enjoy much of the cancelled classes as I had to wake up for the major field test at 9 AM, and I still had my meeting with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;Honors project&lt;/a&gt; advisor to keep wrapping things up. The test was proctored&amp;#8212;as required by ETS&amp;#8212;and administered in the main computer lab. The test itself was not very stressful; the sample questions were good preparation and representation of the actual assessment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/cs_mft_score.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../thumbs/cs_mft_score.50.png&quot; alt=&quot;Test results&quot; class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	My score was displayed and e-mailed to me immediately after I completed the test. I scored 181 on a scale from 120&amp;#8211;200, placing me in the 98th percentile. This is pretty good, and I&#x27;m happy with the score, and how it reflects on my learning at MVNU. I could have done a little better with more studying, but most of the questions could be solved with logic, and that&#x27;s not something learned by cramming before a test&amp;#8212;only years of practice can build that kind of understanding and that&#x27;s what brought my score so high.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I couldn&#x27;t find much other discussion online about the ETS major field test, just a couple &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratchrobotics.com/2018/07/08/how-i-prepare-for-ets-major-field-test-computer-science/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratchrobotics.com/2019/02/26/prep-mft-cs-story-part-2/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratchrobotics.com/&quot;&gt;a student&#x27;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quirks of the results page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/cs_mft_error.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../thumbs/cs_mft_error.50.png&quot; alt=&quot;Invalid key pressed popup&quot; class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The results page pops up the individual results for the test that I took, but interestingly if I press an &quot;illegal key&quot; like the Windows key, it alerts me and leaves the page. Why? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe it thinks I&#x27;m still taking the test.
&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Debugging slow boot and a clogged router</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I powered on my laptop yesterday morning and saw the Ubuntu boot had stalled on two systemd services: trying to mount a disk by UUID, with a 90 second timeout, and waiting for the network to come up, with no timeout. Before the 90 seconds for mounting the disk was up, the boot continued and I got to the graphical login menu. Network manager tried to connect to my friends&#x27; home Wi-Fi, but the connection failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was odd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I had never seen these messages before during boot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I had not installed or upgraded new software for several days.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I had not recently changed system configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My phone was connected to the same Wi-Fi that my laptop could not connect to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hypothesis 1: Something was wrong with my laptop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rebooted the laptop. Always gotta turn it off and back on again. Unfortunantely, the same things happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis 1.1: Something was wrong with an fstab entry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was to look at the odd error out: the timeout to mount a disk. I looked up the UUID and found that it was an entry in fstab that tried to mount an external volume as ntfs, but it did have nofail specified so the failure to mount shouldn&#x27;t be an error during boot. This entry had been working for months, so I didn&#x27;t see why it would be a problem now. Nevertheless I added &lt;code&gt;x-systemd.device-timeout=1&lt;/code&gt; to the mount options and rebooted. Mounting the disk timed out quickly during boot now, and didn&#x27;t cause any further issues. I guess the reason I never noticed that message before was that it does not affect graphical boot at all, and just quietly timed out after 90 seconds in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left the long wait for the network to come up during boot, and the failure to connect to the Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis 1.2: Something was wrong with my laptop&#x27;s network ability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two remaining problems were obviously tied together: Network manager waited during boot until the network was up, but because it kept trying unsuccessfully to connect to the Wi-Fi it took it until some timeout to bring the network up once it realized that it couldn&#x27;t connect to the Wi-Fi. Since I&#x27;m not running a network-critical server with my laptop, I ran &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service&lt;/code&gt; and turned off the boot delay. I don&#x27;t need network capability to start my laptop, network manager can connect later, even after I&#x27;m logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was down to one problem: my laptop couldn&#x27;t connect to the Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hypothesis 1.2.1: Something was wrong with my laptop&#x27;s Wi-Fi radio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my fears was that I&#x27;d damaged my antenna or radio card somehow. To test this, I turned on my phone&#x27;s hotspot and tried to connect with my laptop. Success. While this didn&#x27;t entirely rule out my laptop as the problem, it did indicate the issue lay elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I turned my phone&#x27;s hotspot off, it failed to connect back to the Wi-Fi. Now I was getting somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hypothesis 2: Something was wrong with the router&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The router was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/fios-qgr-userguide140925.pdf&quot;&gt;Verizon FiOS-G1100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis seemed most reasonable now that I had two devices failing to connect. Other people in the house were still using the Wi-Fi, however, with no issues. One key to this hypothesis is that there were far more people on the WAP than normal: nearly a dozen people on the same Wi-Fi, each with their phones, laptops, tablets, etc. I would expect to see unusual failure under these relatively unusual conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was able to reboot the router, expecting that to fix the issue. The problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try using a static IP address on my phone instead of using DHCP. It connected to the network with full internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis 2.1: Something was wrong with the router DHCP server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a static IP address on my laptop solved that connection issue as well. Clearly, there was something wrong with the DHCP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone noticed that the Roku TV wouldn&#x27;t connect to the Wi-Fi, I tried to assign it a static IP address as well, but Roku only supports DHCP IP assigning. It was time to fix the router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hypothesis 2.1.1: Too many DHCP assignments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My working hypothesis was that somehow the amount of people on the network had run out of IP assignments. I couldn&#x27;t find evidence in the router console of too many outstanding leases, but I wanted to try resetting the DHCP server anyway, guessing that the outstanding leases were hidden and only the current devices were being show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no simple option to reset the DHCP server. Instead, I changed the IP assignment and gateway range from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.2.x, about which the console helpfully provided a warning saying it would require all devices to be assigned a new IP. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I hit apply, the problems vanished. I re-enabled using DHCP on my phone and laptop, and they connected perfectly. The Roku TV connected, as did every other device in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&#x27;t know exactly what went wrong, but I&#x27;ve got more experience for next time I run into this kind of problem. Plus, being able to fix it was kinda fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picture-and-performance&quot;&gt;Picture and Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements&amp;#8211;far less jerking the map around&amp;#8211;as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.0.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.0.thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the sample map in the mapping tool&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features and fixes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to extend and merge existing map objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you&amp;#8217;re drawing on or panning over the map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatly improved graphics: terrain is varied and pops out for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-final-stretch&quot;&gt;The Final Stretch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every main feature is now implemented. Performance tuning, testing, and graphical improvements are the primary concerns now: tweaking and optimizing the mapping tool for your satisfaction. As always, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Scene draft: Lusha tries to get answers, version 1</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/lusha_answers_version_2&quot;&gt;second draft.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first draft of a scene I&#x27;ll be using much later. I wrote it for a creative writing class prompt, as it fit the prompt of having characters unable to say what they really mean. It&#x27;s a bit inspired by Hemingway&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Like_White_Elephants&quot;&gt;Hills Like White Elephants&lt;/a&gt; since I read that just before writing this, and the prompt itself leads along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha punched the number into the keypad and jerked the heavy slightly-rusted handset up to her ear. She shuffled around the tangled wire as the handset blared tones in her ear. It clicked. There were a few other girls at the dormitory payphones, but nobody was listening too closely yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Lusha?&amp;#8221; Her father&#x27;s soft voice came metallic and worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba, I need to know something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#x27;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What is it, love?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did you get me to the university?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The briefest pause, then he said &amp;#8220;Is something wrong?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba&amp;#8212;!&amp;#8221; Lusha stopped as a girl picked up the handset of the payphone next to her and clicked in a number. She went on, quieter, &amp;#8220;Baba, something happened and I&amp;#8217;ve gotta know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wanna know. I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What happened, Lusha?&amp;#8221; He must have been very close to the telephone. It usually sat on their living room table with a chair on either side so both her mother and father could talk with their friends at once. Now his every breath rang out through the handset on her end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is that Lusha, Eli?&amp;#8221; her mothers voice came through the line. &amp;#8220;Oh, Lusha, what&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was asking how I got to&amp;#8230; here,&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh,&amp;#8221; said her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s nothing,&amp;#8221; said her father. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are you gonna tell her?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He growled a little growl, not meant for anyone. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;ll be okay. It&amp;#8217;s okay. You can go back to the bread.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have to yet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s wrong?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He won&amp;#8217;t tell me either.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s my business too,&amp;#8221; said Lusha. &amp;#8220;I told you, something happened.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to talk,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Later.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t talk later. I won&amp;#8217;t have a telephone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry love, I can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can&amp;#8217;t tell her now what makes you think you can tell her later? Or is it something you can&amp;#8217;t tell just me? Eli?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t have to say what it is. Just say there&amp;#8217;s something. Don&amp;#8217;t look at me like that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma?&amp;#8221; said Lusha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your father&amp;#8217;s hiding something. I want him to spit it out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha weighed her words. &amp;#8220;Do you know how it happened, Moma? Anything? Please, Moma.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want him to say it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Moma please. I don&amp;#8217;t have any time.&amp;#8221; Lusha clutched the handset with a sweaty hand. The girl beside her stopped chatting with her friend, but she hadn&amp;#8217;t hung up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eli, say it. Just say you&amp;#8217;re hiding it!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father choked out a guttural sob. &amp;#8220;Girls, please&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Baba?&amp;#8221; The handset was too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody said anything for a while, then her mother came back. &amp;#8220;He ran out the door.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is he okay?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you know? I have to know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want you to come home first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not over the telephone.&amp;#8221; Now she was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha froze holding the handset to her ear. &amp;#8220;Moma,&amp;#8221; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big commotion came over the telephone. &amp;#8220;Eugh! There&amp;#8217;s a rat chew&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221; the line went flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey Lusha,&amp;#8221; said the girl next to her, &amp;#8220;Is everything alright?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lusha couldn&amp;#8217;t say.&lt;/p&gt;
