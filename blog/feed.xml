	<title>First Version of an Amethyst Farm</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through trial and error I have developed a kind of amethyst farm in Minecraft. It is neither pretty nor efficient, but it can be improved and it is easy to build. There are four parts to the system: the collection timer system, the piston matrix system, the allay collection system, and the transfer system. Each geode recieves its own copy of these systems, and the amethyst shards are transported to a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Timer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_timer_system.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timer system is a etho hopper clock with five items that is turned into a counter by locking one of the hoppers. Every time a random tick is observed from the sapling, one item is released from the locked hopper. When all five items have been released, the piston matrix fires and the hopper clock resets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This random tick counter is not the most efficient way to mine the amethyst, but it can be tuned and is better than losing valuable piston room to actually measure when the crystals grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Piston Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_piston_matrix.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piston matrix itself is tied to the timer. When the timer activates, all the pistons activate too, breaking the crystals. Some of the crystals will be fully grown, and these will drop two amethyst shards for collection. The pistons will then deactivate, waiting for the next cycle and letting the allays access the dropped items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Allay Collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_allay.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two allays are positioned to cover the entire geode. When the amethyst shards are dropped by the piston matrix, the allays grab up the shards and carry them to a noteblock that fires every couple seconds. They throw the items, which are then collected by hopper and hopper minecart to be sent upstairs. Care must be taken that the allays cannot get stuck inside crevices of the geode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Transfer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_transfer.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer system itself is simple: hopper minecarts collect the shards from the allay system and then put them into a dropped system powered by a clock, which shoots the items up into a water stream where they are collected in my base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_top.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Expansion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/minecraft/amethyst_expansion.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system can be connected by rail to any other geodes in the area, currently I am connected to one other geode but there is another geode ready have its own piston matrix installed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Recent great improvements in Cataclysm: DDA</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt; has recieved some really nice updates to the experimental branch in recent months. My top three are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/67907&quot;&gt;Default sort zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is huge! Now you can define a loot sorting zone as a catchall, where items will be sorted unless there&#x27;s a more specific zone for them to go into. Previously, every time I settled down in a location or mobile base, I would have to set every zone for every filter as many times as there were tiles. It was so tedious that I wrote a Bash script to do it for me using xdotool, a script that is entirely useless now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;mobile-base-zones script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash

. `which qterminal-helper`

# Custom zone letter
CUSTOM=j

# Delay between keys (msec)
DELAY=200

set -x

W=&quot;$(wmctrl -l | grep Cataclysm | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f1)&quot;
xdotool windowactivate &quot;$W&quot;
sleep 1

type() {
	xdotool type --delay $DELAY &quot;$(echo -e &quot;$1&quot;)&quot;
}

key() {
	sleep $(echo &quot;$DELAY / 1000&quot; | bc -l)
	xdotool key &quot;$@&quot;
}

zone() {
	pos=&quot;$1&quot;
	zone=&quot;$2&quot;
	type &quot;YA$zone\r$pos\r\r$CONFIRM&quot;
	key Escape
	type &quot;Y&quot;
}

customzone() {
	pos=&quot;$1&quot;
	filter=&quot;$2&quot;
	type &quot;YA$CUSTOM$filter\r\r$pos\r\r$CONFIRM&quot;
	key Escape
	type &quot;Y&quot;
}

. `which mobile-base-zones-config`

for pos in $GENERIC_P; do
	for zone in $GENERIC_Z; do
			zone &quot;$pos&quot; &quot;$zone&quot;
	done
done

for pos in $DUMP_P; do
	for zone in $DUMP_Z; do
			zone &quot;$pos&quot; &quot;$zone&quot;
	done
done
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;mobile-base-zones-config&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Y if vehicle, otherwise empty
CONFIRM=

# Collect positions from origin
GENERIC_P=&quot;&quot;
# Collect zones
GENERIC_Z=&quot;&quot;

# Dump positions from origin
DUMP_P=&quot;.&quot;
# Dump zones
DUMP_Z=&quot;0 a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q t u v w x y z C D E F G J I K&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/64334&quot;&gt;Plugging in tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is just great quality of life. Now players can plug tools like welders, soldering irons, and especially smartphones (with their unswappable batteries) directly into appliances or vehicle dashboards. This saves all the tedium of continually swapping out batteries, and makes using electric tools just that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/68686&quot;&gt;Brawling buff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there&#x27;s been a small buff to the Brawling style where waiting for a turn or two will grant a bonus to accuracy. This makes melee combat using the Brawling style feel more engaging, and gives more edge to early-to-mid-game melee combat.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Arcana Technoclysm: A small mod for Cataclysm: DDA</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: DDA&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;s premier magic mod is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Magiclysm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Magiclysm, which not only adds an entire magic system and slew of useful spells, items, and locations but also alters the lore of the game to imply that magic has existed throughout history. This lore breaks significantly from real world history, so I prefer mods that keep magic as something esoteric and hidden, such as the newly added mod &lt;i&gt;Mind Over Matter&lt;/i&gt; or the mature &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chaosvolt/cdda-arcana-mod&quot;&gt;Arcana&lt;/a&gt; mod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one particular spell from Magiclysm that I love that is not available in any other mod: the &lt;i&gt;Summon Motorcycle&lt;/i&gt; spell. This is amazingly useful and fun to play with, so I decided to port the idea over to Magiclysm in my own mod. This new mod, &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/cdda-arcana-technoclysm&quot;&gt;Arcana Technoclysm&lt;/a&gt;, currently adds three temporary summonable vehicles and a new location to find the magic whistles needed to summon these vehicles. It&#x27;s a simple mod but fills in the summonable vehicle gap in the more lore-friendly magic mods. The vehicles currently available are an amphibious boat with wheels, a motorcycle, and a horseless carriage with plenty of cargo space. Each of the vehicles is a tradeoff between maneuverability, compatible terrain, and cargo space, so hopefully players will have incentive to find strange warehouses and collect all the magic whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>World map for a Wesnoth campaign: The Paradise Trap</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/51b58ad218fc285717c7d5889fdfeda59f017ca6/data/core/images/maps/wesnoth.webp&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 160px&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;the wesnoth world map&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I&#x27;m working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wesnoth.org&quot;&gt;Battle for Wesnoth&lt;/a&gt; campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/wexlfu-tpt&quot;&gt;The Paradise Trap&lt;/a&gt;, set in the western sea off the coast of the Great Continent in the world of Wesnoth. The world of Wesnoth has a canonical map, but working with a nice-looking map is beyond the scope of my project for now. Fortunately for me, Wesnoth&#x27;s game map editor creates nice enough maps and has an automatable screenshot export function built in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/tpt_world_map_raw_0.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;the paradise trap world map before labels are added&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I built an approximation of the world map in the in-game map editor. This maps out the terrain of both the canonical continent and my own world building&amp;#8212;Paradise. The scale is certainly off, but it doesn&#x27;t matter; I&#x27;m not concerned about accuracy for this map which will only be used at the start of scenarios to roughly plot out the movement of the characters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/tpt_world_map_0.3.png&quot; alt=&quot;the paradise trap world map&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, I use ImageMagick to add labels to the map. The labels are drawn using a built-in Wesnoth font, so the style at least somewhat matches the game. This final image is then used at the beginning of each scenario, and can be used for spatial reference as I write the story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	This is all automated through a script that exports the wesnoth map of the world to an image and then uses a long &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt; invocation to add all the labels. The script is included below for reference.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Map generation script&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>The new DCSS shapeshifter background (first win)</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I got a win playing an Armataur Shapeshifter of Okawaru in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crawl.develz.org&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup&lt;/a&gt; roguelike. This was my first Armataur win, as well as my first win and first real time playing the new shapeshifter background, which is replacing the old transmutations magic school. Unlike with the old transmutations school, this character didn&#x27;t have to cast spells at all, and I could focus on being a melee dude. And what a melee dude I was!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	During the whole game, I encountered only four &quot;talismans&quot; which allow me to shapeshift into different forms: Beast (which all shapeshifters start with), Maw, Blade, and Storm. Beast is a low level form, Maw and Blade are on the same level, and Storm is an end game form (measured by their minimum skill requirements). My basic strategy was to get the most powerful form I had online as soon as possible, training only shapeshifting until the next form was usable, because the forms grant immense powerups at the cost of locking out certain armor and weapon slots, or, in the case of storm form, all armor and weapons. Okawaru filled in the gaps, giving me the skill boosts I needed to keep up in the rest of my fighting skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Beast form isn&#x27;t very interesting: it gives a small boost to (unarmed) combat power in exchange for losing a lot of armor. Being an armataur helped here, because I had some natural mutations that weren&#x27;t overridden by the form that gave me more HP and natural armor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	For a short time in the mid-game I had the choice between Blade form and Maw form. Blade form is a straightforward powerup giving you powerful unarmed combat melee attacks. Maw form gives less unarmed combat power but a powerful auxiliary &quot;maw&quot; attack that lets you regain health during combat &amp;#224; la Makhleb. I was fairly underwhelmed by maw form: despite its healing power I felt I was giving up too much offense for the chance of an auxiliary attack, whereas blade form provided a simple, brutal damage boost while still letting me wear body armor. I only switched to Maw form when facing hydras.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	But those were just stepping stones on the way to the end-game form: Storm form. Storm form disables all armor and weapons, but grants it&#x27;s own significant AC and EV boosts plus insane damage output and a powerful Blinkbolt utility attack. Once I got shapeshifting up to level 21 (and I rushed for it) I switched to Storm form and never looked back. There is nothing in the game that could stand up to an Okawaru-boosted storm form armataur coming at them like a flying electric freight train. I deleted orbs of fire in a few hits. In exchange for this awesome power I was a bit of a glass cannon, lacking almost all resistances due to poor jewelry loot, but I still felt very powerful with some use of consumables and Okawaru.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	There are other end-game forms I never got access to: Dragon, Undead, and Statue (not sure if those are their actual names).
	Of these, Statue form seems the most interesting for the potential to wear equipment, and for extended I imagine Undead form would be popular, but I have no personal analysis of their strengths.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, shapeshifting feels like an improvement over the spell-based transmutations.
	I didn&#x27;t have to waste training magic and could focus on melee. Having the talismas as items wasn&#x27;t too bad for inventory pressure either, especially with the limited armor, but if I had dabbled in spells I might not have enjoyed carrying around the extra items. Right now, any melee character can start using shapeshifting, as evidenced by my Armataur which was a successful storm form menace despite having -3 shapeshifting aptitude. The new forms will probable need some balancing, but they&#x27;re really fun to play and eliminate much of the frustration and useless decision-making transmuters used to face. I look forward to playing another shapeshifter and trying some of the other end-game forms.
&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Dillo Test</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not know what Dillo is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/dillo_test.png&quot; alt=&quot;benleskey.com in dillo&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dillo.org/&quot;&gt;Dillo&lt;/a&gt;. It&#x27;s a plain graphical web browser with minimal feature set beyond being able to draw text and, sometimes, images. Why would anyone want that? Well, there&#x27;s not much practical reason now&amp;#8212;every modern browser supports a truckload of features beyond simple HTML&amp;#8212;but it does indicate a simplicity and graceful degradation that is aesthetically desirable. This website, for instance, is entirely usable in Dillo. Javascript doesn&#x27;t work, but everything has a fallback. If your site works in Dillo, then it is &lt;i&gt;simple enough&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s not even difficult to make this site work in Dillo. In fact, it avoids any kind of bloat. This site can&#x27;t rely on Javascript, or on complicated styling, or on anything but simple text to get its message across. Functionality beyond that is, as is traditional, just window dressing on top of a simple HTML structure. Common? No. But if your site works in Dillo it will probably satisfy the hacker hipsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, take it further and make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lynx.invisible-island.net/&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; test &lt;b&gt;;)&lt;/b&gt;. You&#x27;d better hope you&#x27;ve got alt text on your &lt;i&gt;img&lt;/i&gt; elements!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Mapping tool 0.6.2 release &amp; thanks to all testers</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for supporting the development of the mapping tool with your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.6.2 of the mapping tool is out, with several important improvements including unlimited scale and image exporting. This is the last version of the mapping tool to be developed as an MVNU project, as I have graduated! In the future, the mapping tool will be developed as an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download it here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the online demo here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/demo&quot;&gt;https://mapper1024.github.io/demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_0.6.2.thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the sample map in the mapping tool&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;image-exporting&quot;&gt;Image Exporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now save parts of the map as images to be used as illustrations for a book, for a website, or for whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unlimited-scale&quot;&gt;Unlimited Scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of your maps is now unlimited, with a few handy controls to set exactly what scale you want to edit your map at at any given moment: you can edit on the scale of meters to design a city, or on the scale of hundreds of kilometers to design a continent. Whatever you like, all in the same map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I graduated doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the mapping tool is done. I&amp;#8217;m going to keep working on it! Features like altitude controls, better performance, alternate graphical styles, and more are all in the pipeline. I&amp;#8217;ll also be releasing the tool as an open source project so that anyone interested can contribute ideas, code, and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-in-touch&quot;&gt;Stay in Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to e-mail me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ben@benleskey.com&quot;&gt;ben@benleskey.com&lt;/a&gt; for anything! You can also post feature requests or bug reports using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/issues&quot;&gt;mapping tool issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to keep up with development of the mapping tool and try out new releases, all mapping tool news is posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/aka/mappingtoolnews&quot;&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/tags/mappingtool.feed.xml&quot;&gt;rss feed for news&lt;/a&gt; is available, as well as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/releases.atom&quot;&gt;atom feed for releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support, and I hope you continue to enjoy the mapping tool as it grows and evolves!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>I graduated from MVNU!</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mvnu_grad_ribbon.png&quot; alt=&quot;ribbon cut just before the baccalaureate service&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from MVNU yesterday, &lt;i&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; Honors scholar! &lt;small&gt;I did it, an A in every class!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#x27;m really done&lt;/i&gt; hit me in a small way now that I can clean up all the academic files and folders and apps I have hanging around my computers. I don&#x27;t need my LMS anymore. Most of my hundreds of old assignments are worth as much as the paragraphs I wrote in 3rd grade. Notebooks filled with doodles and math homework are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the important things I started during my time at MVNU won&#x27;t stop just because I graduated. Projects like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;mapping tool&lt;/a&gt; and the creative writing work that I&#x27;ve done will continue, the dozens of good friends I&#x27;ve made are still my friends even now that we&#x27;ve gone our separate ways, and all the social and academic knowledge pounded into my head is solidly &lt;b&gt;there&lt;/b&gt;, ready for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Prototype post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator for the Minetest engine</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tigris-mt/roadtrip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&#x27;ve begun work on a game project, smaller in scope and more relaxing than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/textengine_intro&quot;&gt;text engine project&lt;/a&gt;. This new project uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; engine for voxel graphics, entities, and physics. This game, Roadtrip, is designed along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017180/The_Long_Drive/&quot;&gt;The Long Drive&lt;/a&gt; as a post-apocalyptic roadtrip simulator and also takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cataclysmdda.org&quot;&gt;Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead&lt;/a&gt;. It&#x27;s written in Lua.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minetest&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minetest.net&quot;&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Voxels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine provides a solid base for this type of game: procedural generation, low-poly graphics, built-in multiplayer, etc. I have quite a bit of experience with Minetest and Lua, so it&#x27;s a good choice for game engine since I don&#x27;t want to put too much development effort into this game. The world will consist of &quot;voxels&quot;, blocks like in Minecraft that form the terrain, along with moveable &quot;entities&quot; such as the vehicles and the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic design of the game is the player driving down a road in a procedurally generated environment. The player must survive (food, water, gasoline/electricity, shelter, etc.) as long as possible while enjoying the view and trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like The Long Drive, Roadtrip will have a long highway extending indefinitely into the distance with a randomly generated environment surrounding it, maybe including side roads or broader road networks. The prototype environment will be a desert, but it will be easy to add new biomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the prototype, the road runs from the south toward the north, with turns and corners defined by an equation that returns the X (east-west) coordinate of the road based on the Z (north-south) coordinate. The current equation is defined as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code language=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;local z_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()
local z_factor_2 = 160 + 160 * seed_random()
local x_factor = 60 + 60 * seed_random()

local function road_x(z)
	return math.floor(math.sin(z / z_factor) * (math.sin(z / z_factor_2) ^ 4) * x_factor + 0.5)
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; where &lt;em&gt;seed_random()&lt;/em&gt; is a random generator returning a random number between 0 and 1 according to the world seed. All other properties of the world, like the width of the road at any point, will be defined by similar procedural generation to ensure continuity as each chunk of the map is generated separately.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vehicles&quot;&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicles are the focus of Roadtrip, so they will be very customizable. Vehicles will be individual components internally, such as the chassis, the wheels, the doors, etc., which can then be installed together and the models attached to display an entire car, truck, or other vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;survival&quot;&gt;Survival&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survival elements including hunger, thirst, weather, and fuel will drive further exploration and resource gathering. There may be enemies as well, or some other active threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploration&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources will be available in structures off the road, in abandoned cars, or from natural resources like lakes or trees. This will encourage exploration off road, both with and without a vehicle. Terrain generation can be improved to have hills, valleys, caves, etc. to spice up the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Development Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minetest engine is limited in a number of ways that will make development more challenging. I do think my familiarity with the engine along the engine&#x27;s simplicity will make it worth it, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rotation&quot;&gt;Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most noticably, if the player is attached to an object and the object rotates, the player&#x27;s viewport does not rotate with the object. My workaround, rotating both at the same time, suffers from network lag causing noticable drift that the player must manually correct. I may need to contribute a feature to the engine to support this for more realistic driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collision&quot;&gt;Collision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For performance reasons, an object&#x27;s collisionbox cannot extend much beyond ~3 nodes in any direction before it starts to break. This means that entities like vehicles can&#x27;t be too big or their physics won&#x27;t work. Again, I may need to improve the engine here, or just live with innacurate collision on large vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hud&quot;&gt;Hud &amp;amp; Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the HUD and controls is a bit of a challenge as the Minetest engine is geared toward a Minecraft-like game. Nevertheless, I should be able to represent the dashboard on the HUD nearly as easily as the player&#x27;s own stats. Controls are also a little harder, with a limited number of keybinds available to the game. I can use movement keys for driving, and I may be able to use hotbar items for actions like shifting gears or quick access of weapons or tools.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>First place prize for my mapping tool presentation at MVNU&#x27;s sURC</title>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mapper_gifs_gif.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../images/mapper_gifs_gif_small.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A map being drawn in the mapping tool&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2023-04-25: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvnu.edu/news/mvnu-students-shine-during-symposium-for-undergraduate-research-and-creative-works&quot;&gt;MVNU sURC press release featuring my mapping tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented my &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;Mapping Tool&lt;/a&gt; for fifteen minutes at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mvnu.edu/undergraduate/academics/honorsprogram/surc&quot;&gt;MVNU&#x27;s &lt;abbr title=&quot;Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creative Work&quot;&gt;sURC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on April 5th, taking home the first place prize of the Symposium. My friends and faculty showed up en masse at my presentation, making for a lively Q&amp;amp;A and a really fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sURC itself was interesting. There were around twenty presenters in total. The Honors students presented their senior projects and other students presented their summer research projects in a conference format. In my room we had a wide variety of presentations: an analysis of continuous glucose monitors in diabetic patients, a presentation of a concussion-detecting device for athletes, an examination of religion and spirituality in occupational therapy, and my own software project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sURC presentation was my presentation for the Honors program portion of my project, so in it I focused on how user feedback shaped the development of the mapping tool with an overview of project features and the development process. Later I&#x27;ll have a twenty-five minute presentation on the details of programming and engineering the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the mapping tool, including download links and a quick-start guide, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/../aka/mappingtool&quot;&gt;the mapping tool website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://benleskey.com/blog/mapper_gifs&quot;&gt;More about how I made the GIFs&lt;/a&gt; used in the presentation.)&lt;/p&gt;
