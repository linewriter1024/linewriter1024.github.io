	<title>Discovering random websites</title>
	<description>The other day I was found by diff.blog who starred the repository for this website on Github. While poking around their bot’s Github account I found that the diffblogbot stars page is a huge mine for random personal websites scattered around Github. diffblogbot crawls for blogs and gathers them all here, in one place. I decided to take a look at some of them, and gather a few of the most interesting in a kind of showcase. Mocha2007’s personal website has a ton of interesting stuff: conlangs, games, toy programs, and more! Their conlangs and worldbuilding are very detailed, just…</description>

	<title>Finding discussion about diff.blog</title>
	<description>I couldn’t find much about diff.blog with a cursory glance over the internet, so I went looking. On diff.blog itself I discovered a post from Roman Martin’s blog when diff.blog found him back in 2020 the same way they did me recently. Here’s a Hacker News subthread from 2020, where the creator of diff.blog, Vishnu KS, is promoting it. Here’s a smaller subthread from 2022, and another subthread from 2021, and one more from 2020. One of the HN threads was linked in a blog post from jerieljan. There’ve been HN submissions of diff.blog, and a Reddit post, but none…</description>

	<title>I'm on diff.blog</title>
	<description>I saw yesterday that diff.blog’s bot account on Github had starred the repository for this website. I clicked through to their Github page, which described diff.blog as an aggregator of developer blogs… started in 2019 to improve the visibility of self hosted blogs. I followed the directions in their README and signed in to diff.blog with my Github account. Once there, I added the URL of my blog to my account settings and diff.blog crawled my RSS feed. Once I saw how it was using the RSS item descriptions to generate summaries, I improved my build script to actually generate…</description>

	<title>I made an RSS feed!</title>
	<description>I made an RSS feed for my blog! It’s a really simple format; I was able to implement my feed just by following the RSS 2.0 spec. Of course, RSS readers are a little less common than they were a decade ago; but there are plenty of extensions for Firefox—I’m using RSSPreview just to test the feed—and with how easy it was to extend my blog generator to generate XML alongside HTML I figured it was better to have a feed than not.…</description>

You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo Once you’ve tested the new version, please fill out the feedback survey.

	<title>benleskey.com build script</title>
	<description>This website is static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a build script that compiles together templates and HTML into the final website that you see, this bit of dynamicism enables me to reuse common HTML and keeps track of tedious bits like blog tag link lists. The script—as of writing—that compiles the website is fully commented and included below, along with the data file listing all the blog posts. build.sh posts.sh build.sh posts.sh…</description>
