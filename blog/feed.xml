	<title>Raymon Ortega #3: Camping out of town</title>
	<description>First Night Raymon needs more supplies. He’d like a map of the area; extra food is good; tools would be useful. It’s almost nightfall; he’s spent the whole day traveling toward the refugee center, but now he’s stuck just outside a city of unknown dimensions. The zombies can’t see very far at night, so Raymon plans to raid some of the houses for supplies as soon as nightfall comes. It’s time to set up camp. His camp is barebones, just a tent and a car, but it’s better than nothing. The tent ensures no zombies (or aliens, for that matter)…</description>

	<title>Raymon Ortega #2: Battery Heist and a Sweet Chariot</title>
	<description>On foot Last we left Raymon, he had scrounged together some meagre gear and a sturdy spear and was about to hike north west toward the refugee center. Striking out across the field, Raymon headed toward the regional dump near the evac shelter. It wasn’t far as the crow flies, though not connected by road anywhere nearby. This is some form of otherworldly hound. Lean and hungry-looking, its twisted red flesh is stretched tightly across its misshapen, angular frame. Loping grotesquely along, its unusually long neck stretches forward, its skull-like head near the ground as it sniffs out its prey.…</description>

	<title>Raymon Ortega #1: Would-be Wizard</title>
	<description>I’m starting a new Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA) game, and I thought’d be cool to document my adventures. Maybe it’ll force me to play more thoughtfully, not falling victim to that classic killer of permadeath roguelikes: Hubris. Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a…</description>

	<title>More RSS feeds!</title>
	<description>I’ve added more RSS feeds, one for each blog tag. This allows people to subscribe to only, say, the mappingtool tag. I can, in this way, use my blog easily as a set of smaller blogs for each category. This took just a bit of work in the website build script; and I cleaned it up a bit so it doesn’t commit temporary files and doesn’t need to work so hard to find the root of the website when I’m already passing that information in the script. I do need to refactor it more, it’s getting rather unwieldy, though still…</description>

	<title>Test post, please ignore</title>
	<description>This is a test post. I recently set up FreshRSS and I wanna make sure it’s automatically updating correctly. I also am still waiting on diff.blog to update automatically. There’s just a bunch of automatic things that I have to make sure are automatic. Huh.…</description>

	<title>Discovering random websites</title>
	<description>The other day I was found by diff.blog who starred the repository for this website on Github. While poking around their bot’s Github account I found that the diffblogbot stars page is a huge mine for random personal websites scattered around Github. diffblogbot crawls for blogs and gathers them all here, in one place. I decided to take a look at some of them, and gather a few of the most interesting in a kind of showcase. Mocha2007’s personal website has a ton of interesting stuff: conlangs, games, toy programs, and more! Their conlangs and worldbuilding are very detailed, just…</description>

	<title>Finding discussion about diff.blog</title>
	<description>I couldn’t find much about diff.blog with a cursory glance over the internet, so I went looking. On diff.blog itself I discovered a post from Roman Martin’s blog when diff.blog found him back in 2020 the same way they did me recently. Here’s a Hacker News subthread from 2020, where the creator of diff.blog, Vishnu KS, is promoting it. Here’s a smaller subthread from 2022, and another subthread from 2021, and one more from 2020. One of the HN threads was linked in a blog post from jerieljan. There’ve been HN submissions of diff.blog, and a Reddit post, but none…</description>

	<title>I'm on diff.blog</title>
	<description>I saw yesterday that diff.blog’s bot account on Github had starred the repository for this website. I clicked through to their Github page, which described diff.blog as an aggregator of developer blogs… started in 2019 to improve the visibility of self hosted blogs. I followed the directions in their README and signed in to diff.blog with my Github account. Once there, I added the URL of my blog to my account settings and diff.blog crawled my RSS feed. Once I saw how it was using the RSS item descriptions to generate summaries, I improved my build script to actually generate…</description>

	<title>I made an RSS feed!</title>
	<description>I made an RSS feed for my blog! It’s a really simple format; I was able to implement my feed just by following the RSS 2.0 spec. Of course, RSS readers are a little less common than they were a decade ago; but there are plenty of extensions for Firefox—I’m using RSSPreview just to test the feed—and with how easy it was to extend my blog generator to generate XML alongside HTML I figured it was better to have a feed than not.…</description>

	<title>benleskey.com build script</title>
	<description>This website is static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a build script that compiles together templates and HTML into the final website that you see, this bit of dynamicism enables me to reuse common HTML and keeps track of tedious bits like blog tag link lists. The script—as of writing—that compiles the website is fully commented and included below, along with the data file listing all the blog posts. build.sh posts.sh build.sh posts.sh…</description>
